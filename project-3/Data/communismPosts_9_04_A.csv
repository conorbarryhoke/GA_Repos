"In 1925, Konstantin Rodzaevsky left the Soviet Union for Manchuria (The old name given to a large region to the North of China, on the Sino-Soviet border). He had left his native Blagoveshchensk for the city of Harbin where he decided to join the local law society and went under the tutelage of other Russian emigres, especially one Professor N.I. Nikiforov. 

[With Nikiforov as his prefector, Rodzaevsky formed the Russian Fascist Organisation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259654)

Six years later, he became the Secretary General of the newly formed Russian Fascist Party, adopting a yellow bannered Swastika as its symbol. Yellow bannered in honour of his associates, who were members of the Imperial army of the Russian empire and then soldiers in the anti-Communist white army.

He translated many fascist German texts into Russian in a bid to try and unify the two groups, Nazi Germany and fascist Russia, against Communist Russia. Hilariously, one of the völkisch tracts not translated into Russian was Mein Kampf, mostly because Hitler repeatedly referred to Russians as 'untermensch' and the fact that his statements that Germany's lebensraum was to be found in the Soviet Union presented problems for the Russian Fascists. Rodzaevsky wrote to Hitler, asking him to amend Mein Kampf, and upon receiving no reply, finally did translate Mein Kampf into Russian in 1936 with the offending passages removed

Modeling themselves on the Italian Blackshirts, Rodzaevsky's fascists also wore black attire and were armed by the Japanese Imperial Army, to act as a minor buffer against the Soviet Union.

He served in the [Asano Detachment](http://www.chinaww2.com/2016/09/27/russians-in-the-service-of-the-japanese-emperor/),  a group most infamous for carrying out acts of sabotage against the Soviet Union, as they were too small and weak to carry out any high file acts of war. 

They created links to multiple blanket organisations around the world, one of the most prominent being in New York City. One prominent contact was the Russian Fascist [Anastasy Vonsiatsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasy_Vonsiatsky), who was arrested by the FBI for pro-nazi activities, but was unsurprisingly released earlier and died a naturalised US citizen.

Vonsiatsky made a very interesting statement: [""The Russian National Revolutionary Party, of which I am the leader, does not support either Germany's or Japan's ambition for hegemony in Europe or the Far East. The Germans and the Japanese have never made clear their attitude toward a replacement of the present Stalinist rule by a Russian National Government. The sole aim of our organization is to return Russia to a free people with a government elected by the people, of the people and for the people. Our intention is to form in Russia a truly DEMOCRATIC government. Our Party is not anti-Semitic. Our Party has no membership dues; it is financed solely by voluntary contributions from its members and sympathizers. It is not subsidized by any FOREIGN POWER or foreign individuals. Our organization is BANNED in Germany and Japan. Only in the United States can we enjoy freedom of action and thought within the laws of the country. I HEREWITH STATE EMPHATICALLY THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR ORGANIZATION ARE AGAINST THE PRESENT SOVIET GOVERNMENT ALONE AND THAT IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER DOES IT ACT AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR VIOLATE ITS LAWS WHICH WE LOYALLY SUPPORT.""](https://books.google.ie/books?id=eZ91V_t8sksC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=The+Russian+National+Revolutionary+Party,+of+which+I+am+the+leader,+does+not+support+either+Germany%27s+or+Japan%27s+ambition+for+hegemony+in+Europe+or+the+Far+East.+The+Germans+and+the+Japanese+have+never+made+clear+their+attitude+toward+a+replacement+of+the+present+Stalinist+rule+by+a+Russian+National+Government.+The+sole+aim+of+our+organization+is+to+return+Russia+to+a+free+people+with+a+government+elected+by+the+people,+of+the+people+and+for+the+people.+Our+intention+is+to+form+in+Russia+a+truly+DEMOCRATIC+government.+Our+Party+is+not+anti-Semitic.+Our+Party+has+no+membership+dues;+it+is+financed+solely+by+voluntary+contributions+from+its+members+and+sympathizers.+It+is+not+subsidized+by+any+FOREIGN+POWER+or+foreign+individuals.+Our+organization+is+BANNED+in+Germany+and+Japan.+Only+in+the+United+States+can+we+enjoy+freedom+of+action+and+thought+within+the+laws+of+the+country.+I+HEREWITH+STATE+EMPHATICALLY+THAT+THE+ACTIVITIES+OF+OUR+ORGANIZATION+ARE+AGAINST+THE+PRESENT+SOVIET+GOVERNMENT+ALONE+AND+THAT+IN+NO+WAY+WHATSOEVER+DOES+IT+ACT+AGAINST+THE+CONSTITUTION+OF+THE+UNITED+STATES+OR+VIOLATE+ITS+LAWS+WHICH+WE+LOYALLY+SUPPORT.+ANASTASE+A.+VONSIATSKY.+Thompson,+Conn.+July+4,+1940&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n6XqjLFuC4&amp;sig=TVZZh-2aDv_RIsniVJ9wKfBgXKI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid28Pj2J_dAhVlAsAKHW2GAzMQ6AEwAHoECAsQAQ)

Rodzaevsky and his fascist followers attended the anniversary of the founding of the Japanese empire and honoured Emperor Hirohito with praise for his anti-Soviet efforts.

Hirohito's forces used the Russian Fascists to [kidnap 'disloyal' White army Russians for use in experiments in Japan's infamous unit 731](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t8sdihXN47wC&amp;pg=PA305)

Rodzaevsky installed a [giant flashing neon swastika at the Russian club in Manzhouli](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/RFP_Manchouli_Swastica.jpg), just three kilometres from the Soviet Border, in a bid to rub into the faces of the Soviet leadership that they had yet to catch him and that they had fascists on another of their doorsteps. 

The German Reich Ministry of War's physchological warfare lab created pamphlets urging Red army soldiers to overthrow the ""Jew Commissars"", the pamphlets were supposed to [be spread by the Russian Fascist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht)


Notoriously anti-semitic, Rodzaevsky published numerous pamphlets calling for the destruction of Jews wholesale and wrote extensively in his party paper ""Nash Put"" on 'The Jewish Problem'

Rodzaevsky demanded the Japanese assist him in his attempt to overthrow the Bolsheviks, but they relegated him to sabotage acts.

Towards the end of the war, Comrade Soldiers of the Worker's and Peasant's Red Army advanced on his position. Like the coward he was, Rodzaevsky adopted National Bolshevism in a desperate bid to save his life, praising Stalin as ""The unknown leader"" he had envisioned who was [""capable of overturning the Jewish government and creating a new Russia...by the will of fate, of his own genius, and of millions of toilers, Comrade J.V. Stalin, the leader of the peoples""](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259654?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)

The Soviets promised him freedom and a job in one of the newspapers, and Rodzaevsky eagerly relented. 

Once back in Soviet Russia, the Bolsheviks immediately captured him and executed him. Whilst imprisoning many of his co-conspirators.

Post his return, other National Bolsheviks like Nikolai Ustrialov returned and were not met with execution, but mistrust due to their past associations.

They don't sell their labour to make a living even though they otherwise would, they invest all their time and energy in an inherently anti-social activity which does not benefit society in the slightest or produce anything of value, they live parasitically off of ordinary working-class people who provide gambling companies with their profits in the first place. Come the revolution, they'll be useless.

"Lenin and Trotsky both explained how Russia, despite being the most backward of the major capitalist countries, could launch a successful proletarian revolution before the advanced countries in Europe - and in 1917, this did indeed happen. There is an explanation for this when we look at it from a dialectical point of view. As Trotsky explained, Russia's very backwardness created the material conditions that allowed for the Russian proletariat to seize power before the proletariat in the West, as the bourgeoisie (the class meant to develop capitalism) was too weak and small to play a progressive role, and too tied to the interests of the landlords and the autocracy, as well as foreign capital, to have any interest in promoting democracy or an independent, national form of capitalism. Furthermore, the fact that Russia was forced to rely on ideas and technology imported ready-made from the West meant that it could expend all of the effort that would otherwise have been spent on organically developing capitalism on simply improving the ideas and technique imported from the West. With the newest innovations and technology came the newest political ideas - i.e. Marxism - which found an audience among the small but militant proletariat. Because it developed so quickly it did not have time to be corrupted by right-wing liberal reformists in the trade unions like, say, the British proletariat.

However, I am yet to come across a complete dialectical explanation for why America, the most advanced capitalist country, despite its advanced nature, is also the most conservative, the most backward, the most regressive concerning the sphere of political ideology and religion (which is, of course, a form of ideology). It has never developed a mass workers' party, with both political parties being dominated by the interests of Capital. Most people believe in some sort of deity, and, until recently, most were also regular church-goers. Megachurches filled with thousands and thousands of people are headed by self-proclaimed ""men of God"" that try to mix religion with business and justify the selfish and materialistic nature of capitalism with reference to the Bible. Significant minorities hold openly racist views, and at least one of the two major parties is filled with openly racist or fanatically religious politicians holding office.

I will try and answer my own question, based on my own understanding of Marxism and American history. America, having been for much of its history the most prosperous capitalist nation, has never felt the need for large-scale socio-economic reform of the kind that European countries were forced to undergo to appease the increasingly militant proletariat. In the last chapter of Capital, Marx talks about how America was so vast that the colonists were able to have their own small plots of land. In this situation, there was no development of a large proletarian class for many decades - indeed, the colonial authorities had to artificially create one in order to allow for the development of capitalism. Only the Civil War allowed for full-scale proletarianisation to take place in America, once the backward Southern agrarian bourgeoisie which relied on slave labour had been defeated. Even then, for much of the nineteenth-century, U.S. workers were relatively prosperous thanks to deflation and the fact that the increasingly prosperous American capitalists, thanks to their increasingly large profits, could afford concessions through increasing real wages. It was really only during the Great Depression that the working-class of America became restive to the point of nearly adopting communism and forming an independent workers' party, but the victory of America in WWII and the destruction of the other capitalist economies thanks to the carnage of war allowed for years of boom, during which working-class Americans enjoyed unheard of prosperity.

The American people long deluded themselves that their prosperity was not thanks to their unique set of material conditions - being a large country with a large population and lots of natural resources - but because of their cultural superiority. America, more than any other nation, is saturated with bourgeois ideology. ""Rugged individualism"" and the entrepreneurial spirit are given credit for America's prosperity. Anglo-American liberalism and the Protestant work ethic are seen as key to understanding America's position as the wealthiest capitalist nation in the world. America is still the most religious nation in the Western Hemisphere. A country which has sent a man to the moon, produced the most marvellous feats of science and technology, has developed wonders greater than the pyramids of Egypt, is still populated by millions and millions of people who believe in the myths of the Old Testament, in UFOs and the moral evils of abortion. The American people are the most ignorant, uneducated, close-minded, conservative and reactionary-minded people in the entire capitalist world. I do not say this to insult them, but as a matter of objective fact.

Since the 1970s and the introduction of neoliberal economics of course, the lot of working-class Americans has collapsed dramatically, and inequality has never been higher. Just as in the years of the Great Depression, millions of working-class people have lost all illusions in the capitalist system. The prosperity of the 50s and 60s is not coming back, ever. American capitalism is permanently broken. Another New Deal is out of the question - the capitalist class simply cannot afford it. Obama's piecemeal reforms have resulted in nothing good for the American working-class.

Young, working-class Americans are leaving the church, rejecting the superstitions and backward views of their parents and grandparents. They are becoming increasingly left-wing. The working-class is more militant and more left-leaning than ever before in American history. Bourgeois ideology is losing its power. Never before has the hold of religion been weaker - every other year some Charismatic preacher gets hit by scandal. Snake-oil salesmen like Joel Osteen and Creflo Dollar - which have made a fortune from combining apologia for neoliberalism with Christian teaching - the so-called ""prosperity gospel"" - are being shown up as frauds, conmen and scum.

So, that's my explanation for why America is still so backward in some aspects and yet so progressive and advanced in others. There is hope yet, though.",communism,Why is America the most advanced capitalist country yet also the most religious?

"Hey hey hey 

So I was reading this book I picked up at the library published by an anonymous French communist group called The Invisible Committee, titled *Now*. In it, the authors advocate for activism in the form of “destitution” as opposed to “constitution.” In other words, creating our own means of production and refusing to participate in the system as opposed to seizing the existing means of production and setting up a workers’ state. It draws primarily from contemporary French examples of activism and protest, but I got the impression that it was trying to paint itself as applicable elsewhere.

"Consider the quote below:

&gt; Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of one party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is always and exclusively freedom for the one who thinks differently. Not because of any fanatical concept of “justice” but because all that is instructive, wholesome and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential characteristic, and its effectiveness vanishes when “freedom” becomes a special privilege.

This is an excerpt from [chapter 6 of the Russian Revolution](https://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1918/russian-revolution/ch06.htm). The book continues to criticize the lack of commitment to democracy.

While, I am a staunch supporter of a proletariat dictatorship which encourages all members of the proletariat to actively exercise democracy, *as long as they uphold socialism*, I hardly think this is a valid criticism given that Bolsheviks were still at war at that time. Indeed, in wartime, taking fast decisions is usually better than taking correct but late decisions.

Furthermore, a widely participated democracy would certainly involve social democrats and Menshevik sympathizers. Noting that Rosa Luxemburg was adamantly against collaborating with social democrats, her request for such a democratic regime seems contradictory with her ideas.

"There is a persistent claim that the Soviet Union funded the neo-nazi Socialist Reich Party or SRP.

The SRP was founded in 1949, almost immediately after the defeat of Nazi Germany It is an offshoot of another neo-nazi party that was founded even earlier from the ashes of German fascism. 

This claim stems from admissions by leaders of the SRP and ex-members, although the Soviets themselves never made a single reference to it.

It would be beneficial to put this lie to bed before its use is propagated to further malign the USSR. 

Strangely, although not for those of us knowledgeable about the dichotomy of liberals, the main propagator of this theory is Martin Lee, an academic known for his organisation's defence of Hugo Chavez and Daniel Ortega. It doesn't make sense for him to make up such infeasable claims judging by his history of defending, quite well I might add, leftistst governments vilified by the west.

Some of the hypotheses and points put forward to support this theory include.

1. That the SRP never openly criticised the Soviet Union.

2. The SRP held meetings in East Germany, with presumed Soviet officials. 

3. Ladislav Bittman's eulogy on Soviet KGB disinformation campaigns.


However, there are several problems with this theory, notably amongst them:

- That the SRP was not simply a nazi party, but more evidently Strasserist party, the fact that a particular brand of their politics might have resembled the Soviet Union's does not mean they embraced the Soviet Union or vice versa. They also held other contradictory stances such as denial of the Holocaust and gas chambers, but that the Gas chambers, which they, as mentioned denied existed, were built and operated by the US. 

- Whilst there were no direct criticisms of the Soviet Union, a quick glance at their party meetings show that they viciously criticised Communism, Bolshevism, Leninism and Marxism.

- Martin Lee's book is genuinely the only source for this. Seriously, I looked. His sources are disgruntled nazi officials and Macarthyite US officials. Not the best sources to base a work on the shadowy ties of the Soviet Union.

- A major stopper to this theory is that the SRP heavily advocated the re-annexation of eastern Germany. Something that of course the Soviet Union would never allow and would be staunchly opposed to.

- SRP's Bundestag deputy Fritz Dorls, the most consistent member who stayed as one despite the massive decline in popularity with rising living conditions, rejected claims that the SRP sought to collaborate with the KPD and other leftist organizations, arguing that the SRP was staunchly anti-bolshevik. Whilst it is one voice among many, it is important to note his importance and his knowledge of inner group workings. 

- The process of de-nazification involved linking nazi groups to Soviet or erstwhile communist groups, to make them seem as bad as each other, in order for society to avoid them both in a Macarthyist paradise.

- When the SRP was outlawed by the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court), they wrote a report on their activities, [There is also not the slightest trace about this supposed collaboration in the protocols] (http://www.servat.unibe.ch/dfr/bv002001.html) of said report.

- The odds of Stalin funding a fascist party so soon after war seem highly unlikely. 

- One of the principle stances of the Bittman crowd is that ""The Soviet use of the Nazi card is not merely aimed at
West Germany; Nazi networks have been for decades an essential component of KGB and related institutions' covert operations worldwide.  a blunder which could have disastrous consequences. "". This idea that the Soviet, staunch opponents of fascism, were also secretly funding it is absolutely insane. 

- It is claimed that a Doctor Fritz Grobba, Hitler's ambassador to Iraq and Syria, who had planned the 1941 Nazi coup in Baghdad and later went on to become a soviet asset that worked so well, he was awarded with a high position in the Soviet Foreign ministry. This is fiction, Grobba was actually a Soviet prisoner until 1955.

- It is claimed that Francois Genoud, a swiss Banker and financier of the post war nazi ODESSA group was backed by the soviets. This claim has absolutely no proof or evidence to back it up, there is no feasible link between the two.

- Another baseless claim, presented by the Bittman crowd, is that of the case of Nazi General Walter Nikolai who, back when he was just a regular intelligence chief, was alleged to have sent Lenin back to Moscow in a long term plan to establish Communism in Russia. Yeah, you folks read that right, Communism was a secret nazi plan and Lenin was secretly a nazi stooge. Ignoring this bs, the real fault of this lies with the claims that come after, that general Nikolai went by himself to Russia after the war. False, he was captured by the Soviets under the personal orders of Stalin, and died in captivity. They also spell his name wrong, as 'Nikolai' is correctly 'Nicolai'.

"As a Marxist-Leninist living in the U$, I’ve always wondered what percentage of Americans can be described as Proletariant. Considering that the U$ is the dominant Imperialist power worldwide, and has been able to leverage its dominant position in the global financial system, to steal resources from the developing world in order to create a higher standard of living in its own country. I’ve always been under the impression that most U$ citizens are petty bourgeoisie, with a small bourgeoisie minority, and a large minority of Proletariats and smaller minority of Lumpenproletariat. I’ve also thought that in the U$, these class categories are very racialized, with most middle class white people being petty bourgeoisie (these people are mainly white-collar workers and small businesse owners with incomes higher then the national average of $50,000), the bourgeoisie consisting of a small number of extremely wealthy white people (these would manly be CEOs, celebrities, and Politicians, with multimillion dollar incomes), the proletariat consisting primarily of Blacks and Hispanics (and a small minority of white people) with unskilled, Blue-collar, hourly wage, jobs that make significantly less then the national average, and the Lumpenproletariat being a small group of people at the bottom of society who have no employment opportunities and are forced to make their living through frowned upon occupations like Panhandling and prostitution (this group is also disproportionately Black and Hispanic).

"# Paul Cockshott - Cyber-Communism

Taken from his book, [Towards a New Socialism](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/), [audiobook here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjHCPWs5sl4&amp;list=PL0-IkmzWbjoZNiItBbuVvKQBdE80tsyhx), and specifically his youtube lectures [Going beyond Money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI01-5zhwdA), and [Getting down to details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTl4b0w6mpk).

## How it works

- Production takes place. All goods / services are valued by their **composite labor time** ( in labor voucher hours, see below ). Factor in depreciation and education into cost. For example, a smartphone might cost 0.5 labor hours. Goods that have neglible marginal cost ( ~ 0 labor hours ) would be free.
- Open, publicly funded research and development is shared by all, with the goal of **decreasing the labor time cost** of every good.
- Workers are paid in labor vouchers **per hour work performed**. Working 8 hours would earn you 8 LVH ( labor voucher hours ). Multipliers *may* be used if certain work is deemed more necessary, or dangerous, but most likely limited by a certain ratio to foster community.
- Goods are sold in public shops.
- Shop managers are instructed to **adjust labor prices so that all goods are sold**. While a good selling out is itself an indicator of demand, adjusting by a certain limited ratio gives more demand information, and prevents unwanted goods from going to waste. 
- Each good now has a ratio of its *sold labor time* to actual labor time cost. 
- If goods are selling *above* their actual labor cost ( ratio &gt; 1 ), that means society wants *more* labor allocated to produce that good. Below that means they want less labor allocated.
- Planners adjust output targets based on this demand. 
- Planners do material balances to derive gross output requirements ( raw materials + intermediate materials + labor ). Input-output tables are solved using linear algebra. 
- They compare these requirements with the *actual resources* available. Some of these might be set by environmental constraints, or limited quantities.
- Population uses direct democracy to vote on how much labor to allocate to non-consumer goods ( see below ).
- They see if the final output targets can be met, and if not, go back to the adjust output targets step.
- Finally, form a detailed production plan, broadcast it over the internet to all productive facilities, monitor production ( and sales ) in real-time. Adjust plan accordingly.

## Essentials

### Labor vouchers

- Earned by workers. 1 LVH = 1 Labor Voucher Hour earned per hour of work.
- Attached to a single person / family, likely through a credit card. 
- Can only be exchanged for consumer goods. You cannot transfer them to another person. Buying absentee property is illegal. 
- Are destroyed after being used in shops.
- Possibly destroyed after a certain amount of time ( to prevent hoarding )
- Labor time across the economy is preserved. If there are 6 million working people in a country : 
  - Labor ministry issues 6 million person-years vouchers to workers. 
  - `0 = Labor hours used producing non-consumer goods ( 2 million person-years ) + labor hours used in consumer goods production ( 4 million person-years ) = cost of goods in shops ( 4 million person-years ) + ( 2 million person-years cancelled for social tax bin )`
  - Workers spend 4 million in the shops, social income tax of 2 million ( to provide for social services ), and the 6 million labor hours are fully canceled. 
  - This defetishizes consumer-producer relations, since you can see exactly how human labor is being allocated, and spent.

### Direct democracy for non-consumer goods

- New enterprises, entertainment, research and development, social services are all examples of non-consumer goods. 
- Society votes on how much labor to devote to social services: education, health care, child care, environmental protection, national defense. If a country has 6 million adult workers, it might allocate 2 million people to non-consumer goods.
- Major strategic decisions taken democratically by all the interested population. Minor decisions left to planners. Information open to all, voting available to all.",communism,A detailed breakdown of Cyber Communism.

I just finished rereading the communist manifesto, and I'm currently getting stuck into some essays about historical materialism, and it's given me some questions about feudalism.

I understand that capitalism is the gradual refinement of relations of production into classes which either own or operate the means of production, the bourgeoisie and proletariat, and that this was facilitated by bourgeois revolutions against the previous ruling classes like the aristocracy.

But, understandably, Marx and others tend to focus on capitalism, so the extent of my knowledge about feudalism is pretty much just that it's what came before that.

My questions are:

What relations of production characterise feudalism, for Marx?

What social classes are important in feudal society?

What preceded feudalism, and how did feudalism emerge?

"i heard about this book a couple years ago, long before i was ever a marxist, and eventually i saw the movie adaptation. i forgot about it for a couple years and then about a week ago i just randomly remembered about it. so i bought the book and i read it, and i was able to experience the story again as a marxist, and now that i have the  story really stands out much more. 

the book is about a man who was hit by a artillery shell in combat and he some how survived, but barely anything was left behind. Joe can no longer hear, see, taste, smell, talk, and on top of that he lost both his arms and legs. he basically just sits in a hospital bed and everyone around him thinks he is completely comatose. in reality Joe is conscious of everything, and the book just goes about him figuring out what had happened and where he is. 

the book was written by Dalton Trumbo in 1938 as an anti-war novel. the whole book is filled with a lot of things that Trumbo is trying to say, but as i kept reading i noticed his approached seemed kind of marxist. so i looked up more on Trumbo and turns out he was a member of the american communist party, and one of the ""hollywood ten"". Dalton wrote the book in the social realist or socialist realist style, or in other words he wrote the book to focus on the struggles and troubles of the working class. the very strong message that Dalton pushed throughout the whole book is that the ""little guys"" (proletariat) fight wars for the ""big guys"" (bourgeois), and the ""little guys"" are never connected to the war, they gain nothing out of it, yet they are the ones who die. at one point in the book he describes it as a slave ship, the workers slave away in the depths of the ship rowing never knowing where they are rowing too as the bourgeois sit above in the sunlight steering the rowers to their demise. the very last page of the book Dalton cried for the ""little guys"" to take the guns they were given and take the patriotic slogans and to turn on the actual threat, the ""big guys"".

"It seems like such an obvious foil to the ""Muh Holomodor"" argument - a time when a natural disease affecting potato crops was exacerbated by English interference into a general famine in which 25% of Irish people either perished, or fled their homeland.  
English laws imposed on Ireland insisted the island remain a net *exporter* of food, even as people were starving in the streets! As one contemporary writer put it:

&gt;I have called it an artificial famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a ""dispensation of Providence""; and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.

^Thnx ^Wikipedia

There are very plausible charges that the potato disease was *deliberately capitalized upon* by England with the goal of depopulating the island, that English could more effectively exploit her colonial holding without the burden of having to deal with the locals.

"Growing up in the heavily **anti-communist** state of Hungary, you encounter all forms of laughable propaganda ranging from the classic ""communism doesn't work"" arguments to the all-star ""soviets=basically nazis"" notion.

A narrative pushed by all forms of liberals is what we call **Málenkij robot** : as the Soviet forces started to liberate (or in their words, ""occupy"") Hungary during WW2, the soviet military leadership ordered troops to gather up Hungarian civillians with German names/ancestry, and bring them back to repair the damage caused in the USSR during the war. Proponents of this narrative often call this ""our personal holocaust"", which is extremely anti-semitic considering many Hungarian lives were lost in the actual Holocaust.

Taking Hungarian POWs back to the Soviet Union to repair the damage they've caused in the war seems to be 100% justified to me, but this narrative assumes that a huge portion of the captives were civillians.

"I was tired of having to debate this on platforms that couldn't allow long messages, so I decided to make my essay here. There will be common arguments answered at the bottom. I know most communists are okay with punching Nazis, so this is aimed to new comrades and those who don't want violence in the streets.

Suddenly it occurs to me that this could be construed as inciting violence. I am not, I am only making the philosophical argument for not punishing such an act.

##Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists

###What fascism really is

The purpose of this essay is not to explain fascism thoroughly, there are several good articles on the web already. What you need to know is that fascism promotes a certain social order that claims to put its people first, but only if they act as the State wants them to act (the social order is also traditionalist and based on false observations, but that's another topic). To that end, nothing is off limits to the fascists.

Everyone not behaving correctly can and will be killed. Understandably, this includes minorities. Racial minorities but also religions, sexual orientations, ill and disabled people are targeted too because, to the fascists, they cannot be part of the new social order. This is a very real component of fascism, because fascism is not democratic and does not care for personal freedoms. It is impossible to convince the masses to abandon their freedoms and democracy and give it all to a totalitarian dictator. However, if you blame minorities for the troubles of the country, it becomes increasingly easier to justify the need for someone to ""put things back in order"".

It would be also be impossible to convince non-fascists to outright kill minorities in the early stages of a fascist presence. People do not want to commit genocide just like that. This is why such minorities are first vilified and you'll sometimes hear fascists say that they should be deported, or, as tolerant as fascists can be, that they shouldn't be systematically persecuted (make no mistake, fascists will still individually persecute minorities even if the State does not). In truth, the end goal is always to get rid of undesirables. Mussolini did not believe Hitler's racial purity rhetoric because Northern Italians were white but Southern Italians were not (which highlights the artificiality of race), but that did not prevent him from persecuting Slovenes.

One is only tolerated by the so-called social order until they are no longer useful. During the night of the long knives, Hitler got rid of many fellow Nazis who helped secure his victory. George Strasser, a ""left-wing"" Nazi who helped organize strikes and unions, was killed then and there. Röhm, the leader of the SA, was also purged. He was homosexual, which was punished in the Third Reich, but the whole of the SA was purged alongside him. Therefore, even good fascists that fulfil their duty to the nation will be killed if they step out of line. Minorities have it worse in that their killing is systematic, i.e. not based on individual acts but simply on the act of existing.

Therefore, fascism is an abhorrent ideology that truly wants to kill people. It is impossible to play on words, it is impossible to say that things will be different ""this time"". Fascism requires this component of vilifying a common enemy, of calling back to a great time in the nation's history. If you talk to fascists, you'll see they all think very poorly of at least certain minorities, if not any person who doesn't look and think like them.

This is also why fascists are not a caricature. If you keep looking for the fascist that is a supremacist, racist against everyone else, and wants to kill all minorities that don't conform to his narrow view, you will never find him. What you will find however are fascists who call people degenerates for being homosexual or transgender, who want an ethnostate (a country with only people of one skin colour, which does not exist anywhere), and who want to deport minorities because they cause issues.

**We must stop seeing fascism as this narrow ideology that must absolutely conform to all of several criteria.** Anyone who has fascist tendencies is at risk of becoming fully fascist, and at risk of rallying actual fascists.

###Debating fascists is a waste of time

The alternative to outright being hostile (not necessarily violently) to fascists is debating them, publicly, and tearing down their arguments. Since the end of WW2, there have been no new arguments in favour of fascism. All of them have already been debunked. What exactly do you want to debate?

Fascists don't care about debating. Anyone who holds beliefs this strongly are not open to having their mind changed by a debate. Sartre said it himself in a famous quote:

&gt; Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.

In essence, the fascist does not care about arguments. His ideology is not based in rational facts and logic, it is based on blind hate. You are wasting time, hours of your day, to make a point that everyone already knows is true. The burden of proof is not on the fascist, he will point in the general direction of a societal issue, say ""look at what's happening"" and that's his whole argument. You will have to collect statistics, you will have to read articles, you will have to be careful with your words. If you say a slur in your argumentation, even by mistake and even if the rest of your argument is solid, the fascist will jump on it and say that even you use slurs, therefore you shouldn't prevent them from using slurs either.

By debating their hatred, **minorities have to prove their humanity**. You cannot ask a minority to debate a fascist openly, for the fascist wants them to die. By debating fascists, you are giving them a public platform to spread their ideas and you are legitimizing their views. If you invite a fascist to a public debate, you are saying to him ""what you have to say is interesting, please tell us about it"". Whereas denying them their platform sends a clear message: you are not welcome here, renounce your views.

What good will be your arguments when the fascists take power? You will be the first purged because you are opposition. Would you go up to Hitler during his election speech and tell him he is wrong? It is already too late.

###Violence is not the first answer

The common argument for debating fascists is that we are in a civilized society and violence is brutish. We are better than savages and solve our issues by talking. This is a paradox, because fascists will strip away your civilised society. They want to kill people, therefore they are violent. They will destroy democracy and free speech, therefore they do not believe in it, yet they use it (Richard Spencer for one admitted to this). They may not be violent _now_, and they may not want to destroy democracy _now_, but it is in their aim -- as I argued in the first chapter.

With that said, violence should not be the first option one jumps to when confronting a fascist. Violence is a tool to tell them once and for all that their hatred is not tolerated in a civilised society. This violence exists to protect peace.

Do _you_ have to punch Nazis? No. You don't have to put yourself in danger either. But you should openly oppose fascism through all means that you are comfortable with. To ignore fascism (as a reporter urged people to do in Portland last Saturday, for example) is to give it the conditions to flourish. If no one shows up to counter their rallies and they all spend an afternoon in the park, it sends the message that fascism is allowed just like your picnics in the park are.

There exist limits to free speech everywhere and some ideas are not allowed. Some groups have to fight for recognition too, such as homosexuals who had to prove their humanity, to say gently, and still have to today. But homosexuals do not want to kill people for being heterosexual. They do not hate heterosexual couples on the basis of their sexual orientation. They do not want to outlaw heterosexual marriage and make a nation only for themselves.

Yet, fascism is not outlawed in public. Until it is, it falls into the hands of the people to do what the police will not do.

Does the possibility of abuse exists? Yes, but it exists everywhere. Courts often sentence innocent people to death all around the world. Disregarding current and historical events, my argument is that **violence should be reserved when all else fails, in self-defence, and only in a proportionate amount**. Debating, as we know, is already a failed strategy. Violence however does not mean to kill. It does not mean to gang up on a person on the ground (which fascists did not long ago, there is video evidence). It does not mean using a gun against fists. It means, literally, to be violent.

If we want to answer the question ""who should violence be reserved to?"", it is simply **for those who would, given the chance, kill another human being or make their life unbearable on the basis of their identity**. As was said in [The philosophy of Antifa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgwS_FMZ3nQ), if you are a fascist, you can renounce your beliefs and stop being a target. But if you are a minority, the target of fascists, you cannot renounce anything. You cannot stop being black, you cannot stop being Jewish. You will never be acceptable enough that they will leave you alone.

##Common counter-arguments

(all of which I have heard)

&gt; If you punch nazis, how long until you punch anyone you don't agree with?

Abuse can exist everywhere and it is not proven that this particular context attracts more abuse. Still, violence should only be used against those who want to kill people for their identity. Believe me, fascists would punch you personally if they had the impunity to do so.

&gt; This person only said that women should make babies and cook, does that mean I should punch them?

No. You should, if you are in a position to, take the chance to ridicule them for their regressive views and not just shrug and move on.

&gt; Antifa are the real fascists!

Fascism has a definition. Being violent is not being a fascist. In that case, all armies are fascist, even the soldiers who fought against fascism.

&gt;But people who punch fascists are hypocrites because they don't want to be punched back!

They know the risks. They understand that they may be punched or killed in return. Which is why you shouldn't start being violent if you are not comfortable with violence! We are okay with that.

&gt; All speech should be free, I disagree with limiting any form of speech.

Fascists want to remove free speech. One shouldn't be allowed to abuse free speech to promote the destruction of free speech.

&gt; Therefore, one shouldn't be able to use violence to promote the end of violence?

Self-defence is a right that must be upheld. In the strictest sense, one is allowed to be violent towards an imminent violent threat. In a broader sense, it is justified to be violent against people who would be violent against you or people you know. The response is proportional to the threat. Just like conspiring to murder is a crime, conspiring to persecute minorities should be dealt with.

&gt; Would you target a black/Jewish/etc fascist?

This one tries to show the hypocrisy of wanting to protect minorities while targeting minorities. Anyone who espouses fascist views should be stopped. Their skin colour, religion or other trait doesn't matter. There was an argument because a black member of TPUSA was targeted recently, with people saying that the anti-racist liberals are now targeting black people. Firstly, there are different groups on the left and not all of them defend minorities through and through. It doesn't make a difference what the slave master looks like to the slave being abused.

&gt; In public rallies, they don't talk about white supremacy or anything like that.

They know nobody would take them seriously. They start by talking about the ""great displacement"", or how things were better when there were less immigrants, then people are more ready to listen. Hitler didn't start by saying ""we should kill people for the glory of Germany"". It was a gradual shift of public perception that started at ostracising and segregating minorities.

Additionally, there is evidence that many of those protesters have fascist ties, such as swastika tattoos or later being identified to their social media accounts and finding supremacist messages.

&gt; Fascists have no power, they only have small numbers, what's the big deal?

Vote for them then, if they're not dangerous. If left unchecked, they will grow bolder and eventually you will have no choice on the ballot but to vote for one. Should we start organizing resistance only then?

&gt; Communists want to kill people too, you're not any better

We want to kill the concept of the bourgeoisie. Individuals are not targeted by communists (but individuals are targeted by racially-motivated murderers today). It is not in our ideology to get rid of people (through death, deportation, whatever), but we understand that the bourgeoisie will never willingly surrender their assets. Those who accept our demands will be left alone. As I wrote at the end of the essay, you will never be white enough for the supremacist. You will never be Christian enough. If you agreed to renounce your Slovene citizenship and become Italian, you would never be Italian enough. You would still be ""tainted"" by being Slovene. But if you are bourgeois, or the target of communists, you can accept to surrender everything and join the proletariat in the new society. This is what separates us from fascists.",communism,Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/95er3h/proussr\_arguments\_fact\_check/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/95er3h/proussr_arguments_fact_check/)

It attempts to debunk pro-USSR arguments, and someone requested a response, so here it is

&gt;2nd fastest growing economy of 20th century (grew during Great Depression)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Wrong**. This argument often refers to this [Source](http://www.struggle.pk/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ussr-economic-miracle-gdp-per-capita-1928-to-1970.png) but this plot only cares about the time from 1928 to 1970.

The reason why we disregard data from 1970 onward is because by that point the USSR had basically reverted to a capitalist economy. In 1965 the Kosygin reforms decentralized and privatized the economy which coincided with the economic stagnation.

&gt;If you take the timespan from 1928 to 1989 South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Portugal, Finland, Singapore, Italy, Norway, and Thailand grew faster than the USSR.

All of those countries benefited from the US bankrolling them via the Marshall Plan. One must remember that the USSR's economy was negatively affected by isolation, war damage and funding socialist countries across the globe. Furthermore, the USSR didn't benefit from the imperialist exploitation of the third world in the same way that the west did.

&gt;0% Unemployment  
&gt;  
&gt;**Semi-Wrong**. There was unemployment but what they did when the unemployment was to high was that ""employers would rather cut salaries, reduce working hours and give staff unpaid holidays, reminiscient of Soviet-era tactics when unemployment was all but outlawed and masking the true state of the labour market.""

Once again, this person uses evidence from the 1970s and 80s period to justify this claim, i.e when the economy had largely been reverted to capitalism and enterprises operated according to the profit motive. During the Stalin era, the USSR quite literally had NEGATIVE unemployment, tens of thousands of westerners emigrated during the industrialization, whilst their own countries were stuck in the middle of the Great Depression.  Also, lowering people's salaries in order to eradicate unemployment is better than having mass unemployment in the first place, as is the case increasingly in capitalist countries. Finally, not only was unemployment in the USSR completely minuscule and based entirely on anecdotal evidence, most if not all of it was frictional unemployment (moving between jobs). This is an important distinction, because it differs significantly from the mass unemployment in the west where there simply aren't enough jobs in the first place.

&gt;Furthermore, it is misleading because being unemployed was a crime in the USSR that would lead to imprisonment.

Mandatory employment is better than involuntary unemployment.

&gt;0% Homelessness  
&gt;  
&gt;**Wrong**. [Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4ljfhy/were_there_homeless_people_in_the_ussr/d3ofuqb)

This person even admits that homelessness was eradicated under Kruschev, but then refutes it by saying that the housing was ""unsatisfactory"", so basically cramped and of low quality. Well, by the standards of the west, he's probably right. But by the standards of the rest of the world? I'm sure people in Africa and Latin America would be more than satisfied by the Soviet living conditions. This is kinda the point, I'm not interested in comparing the living standards of socialist countries to the west, because it's quite obvious that the rest of the world could never be as rich as them. This person then goes on to reference the 1970s and 80s capitalist era AGAIN, I don't think I need to keep explaining why that's not a good argument, not to mention that whatever anecdotal evidence of homelessness in the Soviet Union these people find is still miniscule compared to most capitalist countries. Finally, it's also worth mentioning that 50% of Soviet homes were burnt to the ground during WWII.

&gt;saved the world from Nazi Germany  
&gt;  
&gt;... after allying with Hitler and invading Poland, Finland, and the Baltics.

What a shit deflection. First of all, ""allying with Hitler"" doesn't change the fact that the Soviets DID indeed save the world from Nazi Germany, it's an indisputable fact, 80-90% of Nazi casualties were inflicted on the Eastern Front. Secondly, he didn't ally with Hitler, that's just blatantly untrue, he signed a non-aggression pact with the Nazis after every other country in Europe had already done the same. Were Britain and France therefore allies of Hitler? NO! If anything, by your own logic, Britain were more of an ally to Hitler than the Soviet Union were, since they let the Nazis take Austria, Czechoslovakia and West Poland before they decided to step in. By the way, the Soviets only signed the pact with Hitler AS A LAST RESORT, they'd already attempted to form an anti-fascist alliance with Britain and France FOR YEARS. In fact, the Soviets were the only ones who even bothered to help prevent the spread of fascism, sending supplies to Republican Spain and Nationalist China when no-one else did. Here's a little history lesson. Right before Stalin signed the pact with Hitler, he offered to send one million troops through Poland to the German border, IF Britain and France ALSO attacked Germany from the west. Guess what happened? Britain, France and Poland all refused the offer because they hated communism just as much as Nazism, they wanted Germany and the Soviet Union to destroy each other before they stepped in. Hence, the US and UK delayed the opening of a second front for 3 years, at which point the Red Army had suffered millions of casualties. Harry Truman even said so himself that ""if Germany are winning, we will help Russia, if Russia are winning, we will help Germany, let them destroy each other"". Now, at this point, step into the shoes of the Soviets. They had no allies, they'd only began their industrialization a decade earlier, and they were completely unprepared for a conflict with the Nazis, who they assumed could attack them at any moment. Given all of this, the pact with Hitler was basically the only option left. Those 2 extra years out of conflict gave them time to organize and prepare the army, finish industrializing, and most importantly, evacuate all the factories to Siberia. The Red Army was, undoubtedly, completely unprepared in 1939, all you have to do is look at the Winter War, where the Finns killed the Soviets at a 10:1 ratio, to see this. Had the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1939, it is likely Hitler would’ve won. In regards to the Soviets annexing Eastern Poland, Finland and the Baltics, they had justifiable reasons for doing so. Not only did it create a buffer between the Nazis, it also meant that millions of Jews in these countries escaped Nazi persecution.

&gt;invented space travel  
&gt;  
&gt;**True**. I have to add that they did that because of military purposes.

Not an argument, I could say the same about the iPhone, which was mostly developed in the state sector with several key components developed by the US military, but I guess that would debunk the glorious innovation of the free market, lol.

&gt;End the centuries-long cycle of famine in Eastern Europe  
&gt;  
&gt;**True**. There were famines until 1947.

Referring to the 1947 famine is extremely disingenuous, considering that particular famine was caused almost entirely by war damage. The Soviet Union ended the cycle of famine by 1934, and at that point collectivization had doubled grain production, with enough of it in state emergency reserves to feed the country for two years in the event of another shortage.

&gt;higher daily caloric consumption than the USA  
&gt;  
&gt;**Wrong**.

I don’t really have anything to add here, this person is claiming that the FAO inflated Soviet data, whether or not that’s true, I don’t know. Either way, it’s quite clear that the average citizen in the Eastern Bloc was not struggling for food, as the dishonest bourgeois narrative claims. I will say that comparing the Soviet Union, an isolated war-torn country, to the US, arguably the largest global economic empire in world history, is not exactly fair.

&gt;End racial inequality  
&gt;  
&gt;**Wrong**. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_Soviet_Union)

Lol, a fucking Wikipedia article which cites Robert fucking Conquest of all people, how pathetic. The USSR guaranteed equality of political power for all ethnicities via the Soviet of Nationalities. Furthermore, many African Americans actually defected to the Soviet Union in order to gain greater civil rights. Paul Robeson, a black American and the voice for the English version of the USSR anthem, said that the first time he stepped on Soviet soil, was the first time he felt like a “full human being”. In regards to the Wikipedia article and its list of supposed “ethnic cleansing” in the Soviet Union, it refers to the Holodomor famine (bullshit Nazi propaganda myth), various NKVD operations during the Great Purge (committed by Yezhov, who was later executed for his crimes, behind Stalin’s back), persecution of Jews (zero evidence whatsoever that this was motivated by anti-Semitic intent) and mass deportations during WWII (committed for non-racial reasons in order to evacuate civilians from the warzone, and because various groups were found guilty of collaborating with the Nazis). It’s worth mentioning that several countries carried out deportations during WWII, namely America who put 100,000 Japanese-American citizens into literal concentration camps. The deported ethnicities in the Soviet Union weren’t jailed or shot, they were resettled, there’s a big difference.

&gt;End gender inequality  
&gt;  
&gt;This **depends** on what they mean with gender inequality

Not an argument. Fact of the matter is that women’s rights in the Soviet Union were significantly more advanced than the rest of the world. I guess you can point to the criminalization of abortion under Stalin, that’s a legitimate argument, but this ban was lifted in 1955 and regardless, Soviet Union were the first country to allow abortion in all circumstances.

&gt;free education at all levels  
&gt;  
&gt;**True**. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean that the education was as good as the western education.

He provides absolutely zero evidence for this claim whatsoever. Although I don't know anything specifically about Soviet education, I do know that education in communist countries is generally better anyway. For example, Cuba is praised for having the best medical schools in the world, and there are currently 20,000 international students from all over the world enrolled at the Latin American School of Medicine. Furthermore, in post-WWII Germany, millions of West Germans got their higher education in the east before emigrating to the west in search of higher salaries.

&gt;99% literacy rate  
&gt;  
&gt;**True** and the former USSR republics still have high literacy rates despite capitalism.

OK, and? The literacy rate still went down after capitalist restoration, and historically communist countries have always had higher literacy rates than the rest of the world.

&gt;Most doctors per capita in the world  
&gt;  
&gt;**True**. ""In 1985, during the Soviet era, there were 3.9 doctors for every 1,000 people. In the same year in the U.S., there were 1.7, while in Japan the figure was 1.5. "" but the **healthcare wasn't always free**: ""Also contrary to its design, Soviet health care is not free. Patients treated in the public system are often required to pay doctors and nurses under the table in order to assure that medications be administered or that an operation be performed. A Soviet newspaper recently published some sample “prices”: 500 rubles for an operation or delivery (the average monthly salary in the USSR is 200 rubles), 300 rubles for a 20-day hospital stay, 25 rubles or the donation of a unit of blood by a relative to assure admission to the hospital.  Most patients must purchase medications and appliances at prices that include “surcharges” demanded by sellers who manage to overcome bureaucratic obstacles and short supplies. "" [Source](https://nintil.com/2016/03/29/the-soviet-union-healthcare)

I can’t comment on how accurate this source is, but FOR THE ONE MILLIONTH FUCKING TIME, this person is cherry-picking information from the 1980s period of capitalist reform.

&gt;Eliminated poverty  
&gt;  
&gt;**Wrong**. ""The USSR managed to reduce inequality and poverty with respect to pre-revolutionary times, and it did deliver in bringing a level of equality comparable to that of Nordic countries. However, it wasn’t successful in eliminating poverty, inequalities between republics, differences between the urban and rural areas, and even the ‘distinctions between physical and mental work’. "" [Source](https://nintil.com/2017/03/14/the-soviet-union-poverty-and-inequality)

So basically they didn’t achieve full communism, which no-one denies. The USSR eliminated poverty in the sense that everyone was provided with their basic needs, this is an undeniable fact. I should also mention that this person has used the same source twice in a row, and, imagine my shock, he’s used data exclusively from the 1970s.

&gt;1991 Switch to Capitalism  
&gt;  
&gt;In my opinion, the time after the USSR can be divided into two epochs: The transition from 1991-1999 and the time after that. Pro-USSR people only look at the transition phase in which capital was leaving the country en masse, [with close to $150 billion worth flowing out between 1992 and 1999](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/012116/russian-economy-collapse-soviet-union.asp). Things really became worse at that time but after the world saw that the former USSR wouldn't become socialist again, capital was [going into the former USSR states](https://static.businessinsider.com/image/4eaf0d346bb3f7f10900000e/image.jpg) and everything became better than at the time of the USSR. Life expectancy grew by 10 years within 20 years while it nearly stagnated in the USSR since the late 1960s ([Source](https://en.actualitix.com/chart/est/estonia-life-expectancy-at-birth.png)). GDP PC grew exponentially ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union#/media/File:FormerUSSRRepublicsGDPPC.svg)). etc etc

So basically he’s admitted that capitalist Russia only improved after they switched from being a victim of imperialism, to themselves becoming an imperialist power coupled with tons of foreign investment, therefore it isn’t a fair comparison. This is the same reason why socialists aren’t interested in comparing the wealth of socialist countries with that of the capitalist west. Furthermore, claiming that “everything became better than at the time of the USSR” based on GDP statistics is extremely erroneous. Why do the vast majority of former Soviet citizens say that they lived better under socialism? GDP means nothing when the vast majority of the money is in the hands of the 1%.

The rest of the post is basically attempting to refute pro-USSR statistics by citing Wikipedia, not worth my time

"Hey comrades, maybe y’all can help me out with this: Why didn’t supermarket workers (and for that matter, why didn’t the consumers protest it?) in the United States (and anywhere else these machines have been introduced) strike at the introduction of the rather insidious machines in most supermarkets these days? Bit of a delayed realization on my part, to be sure, but I really am having difficulty understanding this. So these machines pop up, seemingly to the benefit of nobody. The consumer certainly doesn’t benefit as I’ve waited an equal amount of time in lines for both actual humans and these self-checkout kiosks, in addition I’ve yet to hear of anybody using one and receiving a paycheck from the supermarket for doing what is ostensibly somebody’s job, like people are paid to do that and consumers just do it for free? The employee most certainly does not benefit. I’m having some difficulty understanding how this happened without any kind of protest (or at least without any I’m aware of) or strike. Like it wasn’t bad enough that we’re expected to compete with our colleagues at work but now we’re supposed to, as consumers, compete with the employees of whatever store we’re picking up the groceries in? It just seems like such a blatant violation of both the consumer (who, when utilizing self-checkout, is necessarily an unpaid employee of the store) and of the actual paid worker in the store, for the companies to invest money in these machines that could have been put to much better use in paying the employees? 

Apologies, comrades, if that was a little rant-y, it just really chaps my ass to see this sort of thing happening.

Capitalist hegemony has short-circuited people into buying wildly illogical and ridiculous propaganda like: ""*Lift yourselves up by the bootstraps*"" (which shows the almost religious power of capitalist propaganda, that the impossible can become possible), or ""*Communism doesn't work*"", when in fact **Communism did work extremely well.**

Examples from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/86tqdd/but_socialism_doesnt_work_s/dw7qco0/) by /u/bayarea415 about the USSR specifically: 

- [USSR had more nutritious food than the US (CIA)](https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP84B00274R000300150009-5.pdf). [Calories consumed actually surpassed the US](https://artir.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/compar1.png?w=640). Ended famines.
- Had the [2nd fastest growing economy of the 20th century after Japan.](https://artir.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/captura-de-pantalla-de-2016-05-26-10-15-23.png) The USSR started out at the same level of economic development and population as Brazil in 1920, which makes comparisons to the US, an already industrialized country by the 1920s, even more spectacular. 
- [Free Universal Health care, and most doctors per capita in the world.]( https://www.marxists.org/archive/newsholme/1933/red-medicine/index.htm ) 42 doctors per 10,000 population, vs 24 in Denmark and Sweden, 19 in US.
- Had zero unemployment, continuous economic growth for 70 straight years. see: Robert C. Allen's, From Farm To Factory. (review [here]( https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~syrbe/pubs/FarmtoFactory.pdf )). The ""continuous"" part should make sense – the USSR was a planned, non-market economy, so market crashes á la capitalism were pretty much impossible.

- [Double life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Soviet_Union). After the October revolution, the life expectancy for all age groups went up. A newborn child in 1926-27 had a life expectancy of 44.4 years, up from 32.3 years thirty years before. In 1958-59 the life expectancy for newborns went up to 68.6 years.

- [End sex inequality](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1977,_Unamended) ). Equal wages for men and women were mandated by law, but sex inequality, although not as pronounced as under capitalism, was perpetuated in social roles. Very important lesson to learn.

- Had zero homelessness. Houses were often shared by two families throughout the 20s and 30s – so unlike capitalism, there were no empty houses, but the houses were very full. In the 40s there was the war, and in the 50s there were a number of orphans from the war. The mass housing projects began in the 60s, they were completed in the 70s, and by the 70s, there were homeless people, but they often had genuine issues with mental health.

"The basis of this post is that I think western labour is anything but socialist. If they are, they have no interest in extending their privileges their own borders.

I've been battling with this for some time and feel alienated from everyone else in my union. We sit around patting each other on the back for how righteous we were in our struggles throughout the 20th century. How we stuck it to the man and fought for what was just. But I can't help but feel it was all first worldist bullshit.

North American labour was in an enviable position after WW2. We had a near monopoly on the world's industrial production, giving workers here unprecedented bargaining power. We took what we wanted from the bourgeoisie, which in turn spawned the ""middle class."" Instead of using that newfound wealth and power to further the proletarian cause, we transformed into the debt ridden consumer lackeys that we have today. We ate up the American exceptionalism propaganda that was fed to us, turned to the  impoverished workers of the undeveloped world and told them ""Fuck you, I got mine,"" We spewed out relative whispers of dissent if our states interfered with other governments, but deep down we knew that the inexpensive commodities imperialism yielded us is what paid for our lifestyles. 

It's been this way ever since. The members in my unions are reactionary as fuck. Our executive has been pushing for indigenous, woman, LGBT, etc. representation, but a majority of members are complaining about how they need to ""go back to representing the true interests of it's members."" Which is basically the interests of the white guys.

Now that the almighty white proletarians are under the boot again, lets get this revolution thing going."" It just reeks of supremacy, like we're the ones who decide when the world changes.

"Hello comrades, although I am a die hard Marxist, I am struggling at the moment to see if a workers state could really be established. Do not take these comments as mere defeatist, as I will always be a Marxist. 


But recently, I have be contemplating how the bourgeois overseers have completely destroyed any chance that the people will realise that they are oppressed.


For example citizens in the western world are kept unhealthy by the constant availability and advertising bombardment of fast food.


Furthermore the television and technology has been specifically marketed to break up people and communities and prevent them from conversing together, in person.


Take the American health care system, for example. The poor who cannot afford healthcare are left to die. As I suppose to the bourgeoisie, the poor are the most dangerous.

Don't get me wrong, I would give my life for a true Marxist cause, but at the moment I am struggling to see whether a workers state could be established.

But I suppose all of this has made me really see how citizens are treated, especially in the Western world and has allowed me to be steady on the path of Marxist Leninism. 



My question is what can be done? As I said I would give my life if an armed struggle ever came to my country, but until that comes what can we do?

"Hey. I'm making this post mostly because I've been thinking about this stuff for more than a year and have had no real meaningful and open dialogue with anyone except a select group of friends. About a year and a half ago, I went from a moderate Liberal with some pretty mild leftist ideals, to starting to hold more outright socialistic beliefs. At first it didn't phase me, I just continued to grow as my own person and evolving my beliefs. I'd say about six months into my gradual and slow transformation, I realized I no longer could call myself a liberal, because frankly Liberal policies made me kinda disgusted. It was a weird realization, mostly because the only person i knew at the time who was a socialist was a friend of mine several states away who was also a die hard anarchist, not really aligning with my beliefs. I should mention I'm in my senior year of High school now, in a pretty conservative state. This realization came almost exactly a year ago though, and i didn't really explore it much besides a few jokes with friends about how I loved the USSR.

The main reason i didn't explore if I was a Communist a year ago was my girlfriend. She was a hardcore liberal, like absolutely 100% liberal. honestly, not even that much of a liberal as she held no real, substantial views, except one thing, Donald Trump is bad, Democrats are good. So, for the past year, I sort of just explored my political identity and beliefs on my own. I taught myself as much as i could realistically about Marxist theory, all without tripping people's alarms. I talked with my best friend about Soviet policy because, like me, he is a huge history buff with a big hard on for Soviet history during WW2. I would say the final nail in the coffin, the thing that made me finally realize I was just a Socialist, were, ironically, fucking memes. It's weird to say, but the thing that made me actually commit to reading more and more Marxist literature and accepting that i was just a fucking Communist, was the fact there are so many fucking absolute morons. I can't fucking tell you how many times I've been put in this weird position of trying to convince people the Nazis were bad on a meme page that posted a meme about the Red army. I remember one specific instance, around November of last year, where i read *Marxism and The National Question* when i got into an argument with some neo-fascist reactionary asshole about how Hitler actually didn't want to kill all Jewish and Slavic peoples, but Stalin hated minorities 100%. After that, i was on little reading spree. I started reading PDF's of Das Kapital, The Communist Manifesto, and Lenin's Imperialism.(Keep in mind, i've only read all of the Communist Manifesto, I intend to finish the other literature it's just i tended to not have time when i started them) Arguing with reactionary holocaust deniers and moral relativists that declare the Soviets to be the REAL bad guys did more to push me to describing myself as a communist than any personal introspection, not because i didn't genuinely hold these beliefs beforehand, but because it scared me how those around me would react. Only until i was faced with literal fascists did I accept that i was a Socialist. At first i just described myself as a super left leaning social democrat, but that felt disingenuous so i stopped. Now, i avoid labels and just focus on the substance of what I believe. 

This post is mainly for myself. It's kinda me putting a minimal version of my ideological journey over the course of the past nearly two years. Also, if you guys could give me some suggestions in terms of literature and authors, that would be really helpful. Id' like to think I've developed a fairly decent understanding of theory but I DEFINITELY need more practical literature and shit.

"There have been a lot of questions and discussions among communists online about the sex industry lately, so I thought I’d make a short post summarising what I believe to be the correct Marxist answers to various basic questions on the subject. The main purpose of this post is to help educate anyone who is new or unsure about the subject, to combat some reactionary ideas, and for me to link or refer back to when responding to questions on r/communism101. In this post I’ve used a few slightly edited versions of comments I’ve made on previous threads about this topic (just mentioning it in case anyone thinks some parts of this post sound familiar). 


**What is the Marxist perspective on sex work in general?**

Sex work is objectively rape in the vast majority of circumstances. Here is a simple explanation of why:

Sex work = wage labour 
and
Wage labour = coercion 
therefore
Sex work = coercion. 
Coerced sex = rape 
therefore
Sex work = rape. 


**What about those who are in a good financial position and choose sex work because they enjoy it?**

Firstly, there are very, *very* few of these people; certainly far fewer than liberal “feminists” whose goal is to normalise the sex industry would have you believe. Secondly, they’re part of the labour aristocracy, and the labour aristocracy is not our priority. No communist thinks what these people are doing is wrong or that they should be shamed for it; we simply don’t believe that their opinions or desires should be our primary focus when discussing the sex industry. Our primary focus as communists should always be on the exploited majority, not the privileged minority. We don’t argue that some privileged members of the labour aristocracy “love their jobs” or “choose” to do them when other forms of wage labour are criticised, do we? So why do we do this when the sex industry is criticised?


**But keeping sex work criminalised is harmful to sex workers.**

Yes, of course. No communist thinks sex workers should be arrested or punished; that’s obviously reactionary and misogynistic. The debate is between supporters of full legalisation and supporters of the Nordic model. I won’t go into this debate here; it’s a separate subject. 


**What about porn? What do communists think of that? What do you think of “feminist porn” which has become a trend lately?**

It’s highly exploitative and often misogynistic, racist and homophobic in the most disgusting ways. Sure, you can probably find morally acceptable “feminist porn” somewhere, and sure, erotic content could probably exist in some form under communism, but that isn’t our concern right now. We don’t care about reassuring liberal “communists” that they can find “ethical porn” or that they can still get all their sexual desires met under socialism.

"The PCI was a pretty powerful party in Italian politics beginning very shortly after they broke from the Socialist Party of Italy. They played an important role in the Resistance during WW2, and became probably the largest Communist Party in Western Europe during the Cold War. Reading just some basic histories of the PCI really struck me that they, throughout their history, seemed to do as much as possible to avoid violence, direct action or anything resembling a proletarian revolutionary movement.

During the rise of Mussolini, the formation of the Arditi del Popolo and similar militant anti-fascist squads wasn't supported by either the PSI or the PCI, at least officially. Definitely members of the parties participated but Bordiga wasn't supportive of antifascism (something a lot of leftcoms still do today). The leadership of the PCI did not support militant anti-fascism before World War 2, basically. This isn't exactly unheard of; [some of the KPD leadership that later got expelled was collaborating with the NSDAP in the 30s while communists in the street fought Nazis](https://libcom.org/library/investigation-red-brown-alliances-third-positionism-russia-ukraine-syria-western-left) and the PSI basically signed a peace treaty with Mussolini.

It wasn't until World War 2, under different leadership, that the PCI began an underground resistance working with other Italian non-leftist resistance.

Years go by, PCI grows and grows and has a lot of local influence. They have some disagreements with Soviet policy and actions, and post-1969 are basically an anti-Soviet party. But things really heat up during the Years of Lead. Eastern Bloc-backed Red Brigades are engaging in an urban guerrilla campaign, again something not out of place for the times (Weathermen in the US, RAF in Germany with actions in Scandinavia, Angry Brigade, Official IRA/Provisional IRA/Irish National Liberation Army, the ETA in Spain, Japanese Red Army and the later United Red Army, whatever that splinter group from the RCP was called). The PCI condemned them, iirc collaborated against them and later the Red Brigades attacked PCI leaders and kidnapped a Christian Democrats member which killed the attempted coalition.

The later history of the PCI is basically splits, watering down Eurocom to social democracy and then just giving up in 1991. 

I guess what's interesting to me is that the PCI was a massive party which early on recieved massive Soviet aid and experienced three different insurrectionary campaigns in its history. Yet in all three times it wasn't really supportive of them. It condemned the anti-fascist movement and played a role in keeping the Italian left divided. Then, it only really resumed operations officially in 1944, pretty late into WW2. Then finally, it actively worked against the Red Brigades.

More than any other Communist Party I can think of the PCI put a lot of effort into not being revolutionary. It did a lot of cool stuff in terms of reforms but I really cannot think of another party that worked harder at not being a militant party. In its historical context, it's not like revolution wasn't possible: worldwide revolts and guerrilla campaigns were ongoing; the Soviet Union was still a major political power (regardless of their official politics); the PCI had a *massive* base in Italy and control over many localities; fearing coups, members of the PCI were apparently trained by the Stasi and KGB; the Years of Lead saw a plethora of far-left guerrilla movements in Italy with some popular support, not limited to the Red Brigades, across the left spectrum from anarchists to autonomists to hardline MLs.  

Why do people think the PCI took this strong parliamentary or nonviolent position? What does say about the PCI or its various leaders?

She says that communist countries have always fallen victim to dictatorships, and that the oppress their people (she mentioned gulags specifically).

"Some well intended people I know are quite confused as to why the Marxist left is against criticizing Russia's alleged ""interference in the US elections"" and why we don't criticize Trump for being ""treasonous"". I will explain as briefly as I can; please add anything or criticize as you see fit, comrades.

0) First, a side point: so much of the anti-Russia propaganda is completely unsubstantiated where no neutral body was allowed to examine the ""evidence"" given by the intelligence services; e.g., Assad's chemical weapons attacks in Syria and the claim by British intelligence that Russia nerve gassed someone in England. Simply through constant repetition by the cacophonous corporate media we observe that rumour becomes allegation, allegation becomes fact, and fact becomes a universal undeniable truth.

1) Liberals claim that Russia interfering in the US elections means that Russia is our enemy and the country must unite against Putin. This is national chauvinism to the highest degree. Marxists do not support one reactionary bourgeois state versus another reactionary bourgeois state. Both the US and Russia are reactionary countries dominated by rich oligarchs. We oppose both. We will neither support nor ally with the bourgeois of one country in their efforts against the other.

2) Liberals claim that Russia has violated our sovereignty by interfering in our democracy. What democracy? You mean the capitalist, bourgeois democracy? Was it Putin that created the electoral college, or the first-past-the-post system? Is it Putin that owns the 6 media companies in the US that control 90% of what every American sees, reads, and hears? The only democracy and the only sovereignty in the US is the democracy of the rich and the sovereignty of their capital.

3) Liberals claim that Trump is ""treasonous"" for not believing the words of the CIA and instead trusting Putin's word that he did not interfere in the elections. Treasonous against what? The bourgeois state? Against the words of the CIA, that same institution that led the overthrow and interference of countless countries' elections? Is he treasonous against the international ruling class because he opposes free trade, rewriting NAFTA and demolishing the TPP? The rallying cry for the left can never be that Trump is treasonous, as if our bourgeois democracy is so holy and sacred and he has violated all that was pure in our world. No, Trump is simply a reflection of the rottenness of our system, not the cause of it.

To summarize, the object of our political struggle cannot be echoing the rallying call of the corporate Democrats ""it's the Russians!"" No, Trump is not reactionary because of Russia. Trump is reactionary because he seeks tax cuts for the rich, for increasing the strength of the border, for being racist and sexist, for seeking to crush unions more and more. The Democrats don't hesitate to criticize Trump for the Russia scandal, but when class politics turn their head and the question of his tax cuts for the rich arises, we are met with reticence and silence. This is because it is in their class interest to support such measures.

The working class must absolutely struggle against the extremely reactionary and vulgar Trump, but the political struggle against Trump must be on its own class lines in its own class interests. We oppose the domination of Trump, the rich capitalists, and their Republican and Democrat cronies; our duty is to struggle for a revolutionary party of the working class in the United States and internationally.

"(I originally posted this in /r/communism101 but was asked to post it here instead. Just thought I’d mention it in case anyone saw this on /r/communism101 and is wondering why I’ve posted the same thread in both subreddits.)

Hi comrades, I’ve recently been thinking a lot about the reasons behind the lack of leftist activity/popularity in the first world. What I’m essentially wondering about is whether this problem is basically our fault for being too sectarian or out of touch with the masses, whether it’s a result of the fact that supporting imperialism is in the class interests of the majority of first worlders, or whether it’s due to something else entirely that I haven’t thought of. My specific questions are as follows:

1) How do those who believe first world workers are incapable of becoming communists due to the fact that maintaining imperialism is in their class interests explain why those of us on this subreddit have ended up becoming communists? Is it basically just a coincidence that we were exposed to communist ideas and were open-minded enough to listen? Or is there some more in-depth explanation for why some first worlders become communists despite the fact that it goes against our class interests? I suppose this could also apply to class traitors from the bourgeoisie - is there anything in particular that causes someone to betray their class? 

2) What are the reasons behind the sectarianism and ineffectiveness of first world communist organisations? Is it simply due to the collapse of the USSR and the overwhelming prevalence of bourgeois propaganda, or are there other reasons I’m not aware of?

3) If it is true that revolution in the first world is currently impossible due to imperialism, what are the tasks of first world communists in the present day? 

4) Are there any theories or predictions about how things will unfold in the future? I have a (probably misguided and ill-informed) personal theory that third world countries will, one by one, have socialist revolutions and kick the imperialists out, then once there are no countries left for the imperialists to exploit, the economies of first world countries will collapse and lead to some kind of revolution in the first world (although whether this revolution will be a communist one is doubtful). Obviously I’m not looking for anyone to give an in-depth critique of this vague idea of mine, but if someone could tell me if I’m sort of on the right track or if I’ve got the wrong end of the stick completely, I would appreciate it. 

I know this is a long post and a lot of questions, so I won’t mind if anyone just answers one or two of my questions in their response. I would also definitely appreciate any reading recommendations on anything to do with the subject I’m asking about, particularly the situation and tasks of modern first world communists.

(Edit: Fixed a few mistakes, kept using different pronouns to refer to the bourgeoisie.)

**On the irrational Bourgeoisie and the perspectives of a proletarian movement in the (imperial) core.**

It is definitely not in the long-term interest of the European Bourgeoisie to deprive its labor aristocracy of their supply of stolen value, like they already pushed through in Austria on the matter of the 12-hour-day. They are risking the renewed outbreak of class contradictions, class war, in their immediate environment. This is a circumstance that the European Bourgeoisie, in the development of the parasitic societies of the imperial core, often understood quite well and thus accepted the development of the socio-imperialistic social partnership. This did mean forking off a certain part of their profits, but that wasn't a one-sided deal: In return the Bourgeoisie of the core got social peace; the class war was shifted outside of their realm. For this reason, however, from a marxist-economic perspective, it is not obvious why the bourgeoisie should become greedy *now*. It is after all not like the shifting of the class war into ""foreign countries"" could work indefinitely - that much even the most irrational of the bourgeoisie know. And yet tthey do it. The re-ignition of class contradictions in the core is risked to enable reveling in the bribe money that was previously given to the labor aristocracy.

In spite of the position of the primary class contradictions between the worlds - between the first and third world, which mean between the imperial core and the periphery - the fight on non-primary contradictions is not to be omitted. Among others we see the parallel fight in the women's movement  as well as in the fight of non-whites against racism. While it is the primary contradiction, from which all others derive and on whose destiny all other contradictions depend, special developments make it possible for revolutionary movements to use non-primary contradictions to further the resolution of the primary contradiction. Such a situation is exactly the one we see now in Europe and especially in Austria. In the historic context this is far from the first such situation. The fight of proletarian interest, since the time of Marx and Engels, always stood in the tradition of such non-primary fights, but primary, imperialistic contradiction and secondary, national class contradiction were still quite close to each other. Only the social fights of the proletarian class at the end of the 19th century and their hard-won improvement of living standards, their higher wages etc. first lead to the slow increase of the ""distance"" between primary and secondary contradiction. This distance is the one that describes the ""productive overflow"" from actions on the secondary level to the primary. It should be said as well, that it isn't the worker's fight in and of itself that increases this distance; instead the source of this increase lies in the decisions of the bourgeoisie.

The workers' fight in capitalism is always a fight against the exploitation of labour power through surplus value extraction. The goal of the bourgeoisie is the maximization of its profits, this surplus value extraction, while the goal of the workers is, in contrast, the minimization or complete abolishment of this surplus value extraction. In a society in which no value crosses the borders of this society - which means that all value created in the country stays in it and is eventually consumed - and no externally created value enters this society, the workers' fight eventually leads to the expropriation and abolishment of the bourgeoisie, which in turn leads to the abolishment of the proletariat and to a classless, communist society. However, Europe's and North America's history in isolation is of a different nature. They profited during the transition from feudalism into capitalism long before the exploitation of their colonies, which one-sidedly shipped value into the core, leading to an inevitable surplus of value. When the workers of the core started to stand up for more than their subsistence wages and waging the flames of contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie had to make a decision. In any case the workers would receive more value - the amount depending on the nature of class conflict. But where would the bourgeoisie get this value? From the value surplus created from the exploitation of the colonies.

For the Bourgeoisie this doesn't make much of a difference - their bottom line, the amount of profit lost, won't change. But the repeated application of this principle does make a difference. Demands for wage increase, welfare, pension systems and unemployment money start appearing. All these improvements in the living standard of the imperial core - a standard that in this way exists only there - are the result of the local workers' fights. But the fights' success- and bountiful results are in turn caused by the higher liquidity of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie acted, as we know today, increasingly more forthcoming towards these demands into the 20th century. Of course the rate of profit for the bourgeoisie was lessened, but this was a sacrifice worth making, as they now had to worry less about social chaos, while still being filthy rich! This development, especially the partnership between bourgeoisie and proletariat, from an international perspective, became increasingly obvious only in the 1920s and 30s. The Proletariat was now completely robbed of its internationalism and became part of the nation state, which was now responsible for caring for their welfare. The economically-political co-development of this was corporatism, or to put it into ""friendlier"" terms, the social partnership.

What, now, is the previously mentioned intermediary step in the causal chain?

It is in the interest of the rational bourgeoisie to lessen the local class conflict and at the same time it is their decision to use the value surplus from the colonies on their own working class. As previously mentioned, this was initially limited to simple payments, as in paying more wages that could be afforded through the value surplus. But this developed, more and more, into an integral part of the capitalist system in the core. The value surplus, was, among other things, institutionalized through wages, social systems or pension systems and became the absolute standard. The intermediate step in the causal chain is thus the decision of the bourgeoisie to use the profits of the exploitation overseas to alleviate the class conflict at home and keep the, oh so important for the bourgeoisie, social peace.

But this has been forgotten by the bourgeoisie in the light of the events of recent years. They have become greedy once more and are now sacrificing the social peace they secured through exploitation of the periphery to bolster their profits.

For us communists, as absolutely consistent internationalists, this is an important moment.

With a rational bourgeoisie our work was and would be made significantly harder. All mass politics would have to be built on socio-imperialistic politics. It would be impossible to perform actually revolutionary agitation within the parasitic working class. Their short-term interests simply don't match such a future, it would belong to social imperialism. Previous, actually revolutionary communist organizations also faced all these problems. As a consequence it was no longer tried to extract cheap, small and temporary successes from the wider masses. Instead one knew to, as far as it was possible, reverse the flow of value between first and third world or at least support national liberation movements in the periphery in any form.

These tactics are still of grand importance in a society led by irrational bourgeoisie, but we can additionally start riding the wave of class conflict of the secondary contradiction in such a society. As such it is our task to perform revolutionary agitation in the wake of public uproar over the 12-hour day and similar incisions and also to use this uproar of the core workers along with the exploitation of the migrants staying in the core to build a wide revolutionary movement. For communists, revolutionary and consequent internationalists, the time for such work has come now. We need to know how to use this chance by throwing old, dogmatic class analysis over board and putting our actions under a new, global class analysis.

In Austria, but also in Germany, Switzerland and Europe in general, it must now be our task to use these temporary possibilities of social unrest to agitate and for our propaganda. Also to wake up the workers who haven't already subscribed to the machinations of the global bourgeoisie and try to establish on this a broad, revolutionary, communist, internationalist movement and try to unite it with the interests of the internationally exploited and exiled.

"Dear Comrades,
I found an amazing Soviet poster that's called ""Shine our constellation!"". It is truly great, it visualises the essential point of the Communist idea, that of collective human progress, understood - in its most extreme and sublime version - as reaching into the unknown, into space. I am absolutely obsessed by this image. The trouble with this poster is that, although it has been designed by Communists  in the Soviet Union, it is being sold on the internet by (surprise!) capitalists. The idea of buying overpriced (40$) Soviet poster and thus contributing to the ""growth of the economy"" appals me, fills me with horror. On the other hand I'd love to have it on the wall, next to my Stalin poster.
Here's my question to You, Comrades: do you know where to get a high resolution image of this poster? If we could get hold of it everyone could print one for him/herself (according to his/her needs ;-))
I thank You all!

"Now in [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWWb4puuY0Y) form

One of the novel aspects that has attracted the most attention and even some controversy, is the question of property relations, and logically so, as depending on the predominance of one form of ownership over another, a country’s social system is determined.

In socialist and sovereign Cuba, the ownership of the basic means of production by all the people is and will continue to be the main form of the national economy and the socio-economic system and therefore constitutes the basis of the actual power of workers.

The recognition of the existence of private property has generated more than a few honest concerns from participants in the discussions prior to the Congress, who expressed concerns that on doing so we would be taking the first steps towards the restoration of capitalism in Cuba. In my role as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, I have the duty to assert that this is not, in the least, the purpose of this conceptual idea.
This is precisely about, compañeras and compañeros, calling things by their name and not hiding behind illogical euphemisms to mask reality. The increase in self-employment and the authorization to contract a workforce has led in practice to the existence of medium, small and micro private enterprises which today operate without proper legal status and are regulated under the law by a regulatory framework designed for individuals engaged in small business conducted by the worker and his/her family.

Guideline No.3 approved by the 6th Congress and which we intend to maintain and strengthen in the updated draft categorically specifies that “In the forms of non-state management, the concentration of property shall not be allowed” and it is added “nor of wealth”; therefore, the private company will operate within well-defined limits and will constitute a complementary element in the economic framework of the country, all of which should be regulated by law.

We are not naive nor do we ignore the aspirations of powerful external forces that are committed to what they call the “empowerment” of non-state forms of management, in order to create agents of change in the hope of putting an end to the Revolution and socialism in Cuba by other means.

Cooperatives, self-employment and medium, small and micro private enterprise are not in their essence anti-socialist or counter-revolutionary and the enormous majority of those who work in them are revolutionaries and patriots who defend the principles and benefit from the achievements of this Revolution.
