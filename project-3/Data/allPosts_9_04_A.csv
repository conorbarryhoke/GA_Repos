"Hello and welcome back!

‚Äã

When I started projecting D/ST points in 2012, things were a little different. I did most of my work by hand, to-and-from (and during) work, and the exercise was more to explore what could be done rather than anything too serious. I only ranked the options and did no projections. The thread got 11 comments ‚Äì and only half of them were my own.

‚Äã

In the six seasons since, I‚Äôve made some big changes. Most importantly, they‚Äôve all been good: I went back to school and graduated in mathematics. I found a job in data analysis. I‚Äôm getting married! And perhaps most relevantly to everybody here, the 2018 NFL season will be the first in a long time where I won‚Äôt be projecting D/ST scoring. So, this will be my attempt to unload everything I know so that somebody else (or many someones else) can pick up where I left off, improve the methodology, and continue to share their results with the fantasy community.

‚Äã

Let‚Äôs start with the basics:

‚Äã

D/ST scoring is composed of three main parts:

‚Äã

1. Points allowed
2. Sacks
3. Interceptions

‚Äã

That‚Äôs it. Kind of. There are two remaining components but we will get to them in a moment. For now, let‚Äôs go through each of the three.

‚Äã

**POINTS ALLOWED**

‚Äã

This is the easiest and least important component, but it‚Äôs one where my methodology still made some very na√Øve assumptions for simplicity‚Äôs sake. First, where you do you find accurate scoring projections? My answer has always been Vegas (well, really, the answer is large offshore sportsbooks, but ‚ÄúVegas‚Äù sounds sexier).

‚Äã

[https://imgur.com/a/8eUvzQl](https://imgur.com/a/8eUvzQl)

‚Äã

The screenshot here is from Pinnacle, widely accepted as the sharpest NFL sportsbook. When figuring out scoring expectations, you can either use team totals directly or derive them from the full-game lines. We‚Äôll be doing the latter with the assumption that a full-game line has a larger max wager, less vigorish, and a sharper line ‚Äì but they‚Äôre almost always going to match up anyway to prevent arbitrage, so use whichever is easier.

‚Äã

In this example for Thursday night, the Eagles are favored at home by 2.5 points, and the game total is set at 45. The means the Eagles can expect 23.75 points ((45+2.5)/2) and the Falcons can expect 21.25 points ((45-2.5)/2). A quick check assures us that the results are correct, since 23.75 + 21.25 = 45 and the Eagles expect 2.5 more points than the Falcons. Easy.

‚Äã

While these numbers are great for setting baseline expectations, things start to get really tricky in a hurry. We need to know not just how many points to expect, but we need to convert that single point into an actual scoring distribution. Here is where I made that first na√Øve assumption: while NFL scoring is very much NOT a normal distribution, I assumed that touchdowns and field goals could be tracked close enough to a Poisson distribution. This at least gets us toward scoring ranges that are good enough for what we need.

‚Äã

Anybody working at this on their own should look at this as one of the first big improvements they can make.

‚Äã

**SACKS**

‚Äã

While points allowed make up a relatively minor component of D/ST scoring ‚Äì consider, for example, a team that gives up a relatively average 21 points in a game might lead to a D/ST score of +0 or +1 depending on your scoring format ‚Äì sacks are part of where the money is made. Sacks are important for three major reasons:

‚Äã

1. They are each +1 point
2. They are a turnover-rich event
3. Because they are yardage-negative and result in a loss of a down, they correlate loosely with lower scores

‚Äã

Unfortunately, forecasting sacks can be a little difficult, because they are a function of multiple variables: The strength of the pass rush, the strength of the offensive line, the tendencies of the quarterback, the down and distance, the overall score‚Ä¶ so here is where we can make another na√Øve assumption: average sacks per game by the DL and average sacks allowed per game by the OL can be virtual stand-ins for all of the variables named above.

‚Äã

Now of course, they‚Äôre not, and this is one more avenue for someone to improve on the methodology going forward. However, given how much variance is present in D/ST scoring just because of the rules themselves, I‚Äôm not sure how much better the projections can be by improving here. To get an expected sack total in each game, I took the average sacks per game by the defense, the average sacks per game allowed by the offense, and took a weighted average (giving the home team a slight boost, which may have been incorrect to do).

‚Äã

**INTERCEPTIONS**

‚Äã

While sacks are a function of the offense and defense together (along with some in-game details such as score, down, distance, etc.), I took the D/ST component for interceptions to be defined largely by the offense‚Äôs quarterback. Another assumption (perhaps less na√Øve this time): quarterbacks could be expected to converge toward their career interception rates. This worked great in most cases, but in some of the most important cases (rookie quarterbacks or career backup quarterbacks), it fell far short.

‚Äã

In these cases, I don‚Äôt have a good answer, and I tended to use my best judgmen in the cases where they came up. Sometimes, you can find an interceptions over/under prop bet on a reputable gambling site and go from there. Sometimes you‚Äôll just have to make something up and hope it‚Äôs close enough.

‚Äã

Finally, similarly to sacks, I used a weighted combination of the defenses interception rate with the quarterback‚Äôs interceptions per game, weighted heavily toward the quarterback.

‚Äã

**MISSING PIECES**

‚Äã

We‚Äôre done! Right? Wrong.

‚Äã

There are two major things missing: D/ST TDs and fumble recoveries.

‚Äã

I assumed that fumbles were entirely random, and that every team would expect to recover approximately half of the fumbles they have available, and that every team would fumble at approximately similar rates. I would love to be proven incorrect on this, but I have not yet seen compelling evidence to the contrary.

‚Äã

For D/ST TDs, I took a historical conversion rate for fumbles-into-TDs and interceptions-into-TDs and assumed that every team would convert that many of each into touchdowns. Here is another point of improvement to make in the methodology, and one that I have high hopes that someone in the community can make happen. An obvious blind spot to start with: I did not consider punt or kick return TDs at all, and I think there is probably some amount of variance that can be explained by simple variables that we have access to.

‚Äã

**ASSUMING INDEPENDENT EVENTS‚Ä¶**

‚Äã

OK, I have revealed quite a few na√Øve assumptions so far, and for the most part, I think most of them are reasonable, if not justifiable. There is one assumption that I‚Äôve made however that is not, and it is probably the best place to gain an edge on mine (or other) existing models: To convert expected sacks, expected turnovers, and expected points into expected D/ST scores, I assumed independence with all events.

‚Äã

Yikes? Yikes.

‚Äã

The reason why should be obvious: It was way easier! But consider the two following scenarios:

‚Äã

1. A team expecting 21 points allows 21 points with 6 sacks, 2 interceptions, and 1 fumble recovery
2. A team expecting 21 points allows 21 points with 0 sacks and 0 turnovers

‚Äã

If we assume independence of events, the simplified odds of each happening are:

‚Äã

p(21 points) \* p(6 sacks) \* p(2 interceptions) \* p(1 fumble recovery)

p(21 points) \* p(0 sacks) \* p(0 turnovers)

‚Äã

In reality, these events are not independent, and so the calculations above would be wrong. Using extreme case reasoning to illustrate, a team who gets 25 sacks does not have the same scoring distribution for points allowed as a team who gets 0 sacks. Of all the spots to improve on the methodology I‚Äôve presented so far, this is the one that I think has the most potential to boost the efficacy of the model.

‚Äã

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an easy task, and it‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt tackle it myself!

‚Äã

**COMBINING THE COMPONENTS**

‚Äã

I‚Äôve alluded to most of this already, but to be explicit:

‚Äã

1. Convert Vegas point totals into a distribution.
2. Gather expected sacks, expected interceptions, and expected fumbles, then convert using a Poisson distribution on each (adding in a factor for D/ST TDs).
3. Assume independence and calculate EV for each team.

‚Äã

**2018-SPECIFIC TOPICS**

‚Äã

I sent out a call on Twitter for questions to answer here since I won‚Äôt be getting to anything major in-season. Here is a full list of what was asked, and my answers:

‚Äã

*‚ÄúThe one thing I‚Äôd like to get your opinion on is how high Football Outsiders is on the Browns and Packers DST. They have them ranked 5th and 6th. Is there something they know that nobody else does?‚Äù*

‚Äã

The Browns have something going for them right now that they haven‚Äôt had in a long, long time: Tyrod Taylor does not make very many mistakes. He‚Äôs probably the best QB they‚Äôve had in a decade or more, and he does not turn the ball over very much. It might seem counter-intuitive to start an answer about their defense by pointing out their offense, but with the way D/ST scoring works, a bad QB can be a huge liability for a D/ST.

‚Äã

That being said, I have no idea why they would be ranked in the top 6. Quite honestly, that seems ludicrous. They have some good pieces, but their season-long over/under is just above 5.5 wins. That is‚Ä¶ not good. For a D/ST to be a strong play, it has to be attached to a team that can expect to win, and the Browns just aren‚Äôt there yet. They‚Äôve won 1 game in the past 32 tries. I would let somebody else sit on them, and quite frankly, they‚Äôll just sit on the waiver wire in 99% of leagues.

‚Äã

The Packers are a much more interesting option. They can expect closer to 10 wins, and they are unlikely to be home underdogs in any of their games, let alone more than 1-2 of them. That is a great start. They aren‚Äôt the most talented defense, and they‚Äôve already suffered injuries to starters, but they are good enough to be drafted in all MFL10-style leagues and some 12-team redrafts. I would not go much farther than that. I‚Äôd give them something like a top 14 or top 16 score if I had to guess today for the end of the year.

*‚Äã*

*What's a quick-and-dirty way to rank streaming DSTs on your own (aka without your columns)?*

‚Äã

Easy! Look for the following, in approximately the order given:

‚Äã

1. Good defense favored at home against a bad offense
2. Good defense favored on the road against a bad offense
3. Good defense favored at home against a medium offense
4. Medium defense favored at home against a bad offense
5. Good defense favored on the road against a medium offense
6. Medium defense favored on the road against a bad offense
7. Bad defense favored at home against a bad offense
8. Good defense as an underdog anywhere against a medium offense
9. Good defense as an underdog anywhere against a good offense
10. Bad defense favored at home against a medium offense

‚Äã

In all cases, you can usually assume backup QBs are somewhere between ‚Äúbad‚Äù and ‚Äúmedium‚Äù and third-string QBs are ‚Äúbad.‚Äù

‚Äã

Avoid teams on the road where possible, but especially avoid underdogs.

‚Äã

Look for teams in low-scoring environments where you can expect lots of sacks and turnovers. Full game totals under 40 are low. Totals between 40 and 44 are OK. Anything above 44 starts getting into territory where you need to tread carefully. And remember, a team that‚Äôs a heavy favorite can thrive in a higher full-game scoring environment because their own scoring is a larger share of the total.

‚Äã

Chase sacks and interceptions before chasing total point totals.

‚Äã

If you follow these rough guidelines, you really can‚Äôt go too wrong.

‚Äã

*Will you provide your algorithms and data pipeline process?*

‚Äã

I think most of this is covered above, but please reach out if anything is unclear. I gathered most data by hand (copy/paste into Excel tables) from ESPN.com and teamrankings.com. This is the first thing I would go back to revise if/when I take this project back up, since I have learned so much more about data collection between when I started this and today.

‚Äã

*Q: is there anything we can apply or take away based on injuries or performance to the monthly stuff?*

‚Äã

My blanket assumption was that injuries don‚Äôt matter, suspensions don‚Äôt matter, and that most NFL players are far closer to replacement-level than we‚Äôre able to quantify. This obviously has some important exceptions ‚Äì peak J.J. Watt, peak Joey Bosa, peak Khalil Mack, most good/great quarterbacks, etc. ‚Äì but these should be fairly evident as they come up. Further, we get some amount of grounding on our model from the Vegas lines that get published, so we can see how many points each player is worth.

‚Äã

The reason why we can assume these things is (in theory) because we are aggregating 11 players‚Äô contributions on 60+ plays in a game, so the effect that any one player has is somewhat minimized, especially when it is a defensive player that may only play 30, 40, 50 snaps in a game.

‚Äã

More importantly, to account for each of these missing players would be a monumental effort, and when combined with the fact that I‚Äôm unsure that it would even be worth accounting for, I ignored the effect in a vast majority of cases.

‚Äã

*Will we get a rank for week 1/first few weeks?*

‚Äã

I like the Ravens, Saints, Packers, Lions, and Jaguars in some order. Beyond them (or mixed in at the back-end of that group) would be the Vikings, Patriots, Chargers, and Titans. The Rams probably belong in there too somewhat. Denver might be worth a look but they could also just be bad.

‚Äã

If you were hoping to bank on a D/ST not listed above, you should probably check your waiver wire and rethink where you‚Äôre at. Anything not on that list would have to have a very good season-long and week 2 expectation for me to sit through a bad week with them right now.

‚Äã

*I'd be curious to hear how you discriminate between teams that are closely ranked in your mind. How do you sort out the better option between two teams in similar positions for any given week?*

‚Äã

I always look at their next week to see if I can use either option for two consecutive weeks and save a waiver claim/FAAB. Sometimes you can find a gem that might cost you a quarter point of expectation in the current week, but they‚Äôll be usable or good for 2-3 consecutive weeks. That‚Äôs almost always worth the tiebreaker in my opinion.

‚Äã

If not, I‚Äôll side with a home team or the team maybe just flip a coin. If your model can‚Äôt determine which is better, there‚Äôs really no reason to stress over the decision, and you can more usefully spend your time elsewhere.

‚Äã

*How do you do your assessment of good teams to target a DST against? I know you‚Äôve got your algorithm but does it factor for changes in OL and skill positions?*

‚Äã

Most of this should be covered above. You want backup QBs, bad offensive lines, bad quarterbacks, bad receivers, and teams playing on the road. Accounting for personnel changes in season is difficult, and I tried to stay away from it as much as possible. Sometimes we just don‚Äôt have data on some of these players, and we certainly don‚Äôt have much reliable data on them. I find it‚Äôs better to stay away from situations like that entirely. I could be wrong!

‚Äã

*Q: Which defense that may go undrafted could finish top 12 ?*

‚Äã

Tough one, because I don‚Äôt know what is going undrafted right now! Looking at ADP, the Steelers have an ADP around Def13, and I like their odds of beating that. Kind of a weak answer though, since they don‚Äôt have to overperform by much to get top 12. The Packers, Lions, and 49ers are probably each threats to do it, but I would bet against each individually.

‚Äã

Perhaps a sneaky answer is that most drafters could stream D/STs weekly and expect a top 8-12 D/ST score by playing matchups. By targeting a D/ST that projects strongly in Week 1, you give yourself the best chance to do both (land the undrafted D/ST that finishes top 12, and end up with a weekly D/ST average in the top 12).

‚Äã

*Are there any defenses in particular you‚Äôd hold for weeks 13-16? (Fantasy playoffs) or is it too early to tell?*

‚Äã

You got it right here: definitely too early to tell. The time to think about this is usually right around Week 10 or Week 11, when you can be assured that you‚Äôre looking at the playoffs and your own worst bye weeks are over. Plus, there‚Äôs almost no way to tell right now which ones will be worth holding and which won‚Äôt be.

‚Äã

And that should do it for 2018. For anybody who would like to start doing their own projections, I strongly recommend exploring the math behind what does/doesn‚Äôt work and what does/doesn‚Äôt matter. If you find yourself hitting a wall along the way, feel free to reach out, but I do request that you try to make some headway on your own first. :) Beyond that though, I am happy to help almost any way I can.

‚Äã

So with that: Fuck ICE, be generous, treat the people around you with the respect they deserve, and kick some ass in 2018.

"On their way to get married, a young Catholic couple were involved in a fatal car accident. The couple found themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven.  
While waiting they began to wonder; Could they possibly get married in Heaven?  
When St. Peter arrived they asked him if they could get married in Heaven.  
St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he left.  
The couple sat and waited for an answer.... for a couple of months.  
While they waited, they discussed the pros and cons. If they were allowed to get married in Heaven, should they get married, what with the eternal aspect of it all?  
What if it doesn't work? Are we stuck in Heaven together forever?'  
Another month passed. St. Peter finally returned, looking somewhat bedraggled.  
‚ÄúYes,' he informed the couple, 'You can get married in Heaven.'  
'Great!' said the couple. 'But we were just wondering; what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'  
St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard on the ground.

Back in 2014 I was working for a big company, where I had been for just shy of 12 years. My job was on the way out because of automation but I was fine with this, it was time to move on. My company, however, were treating me and my team like pieces of shit, and as the team manager, I wasn‚Äôt letting them get away with fucking my guys about. This made me unpopular with senior management. 

One day I was called into a room and told my job was being changed dramatically. I argued that they were trying to avoid paying me my severance as stipulated in my contract (would've been about $60k) by making me so bored I‚Äôd quit. I demanded to see a new job description so I knew for sure what they expected me to do in my 40 hour week (my job was now taking 3-4 hours a week to do) and made it clear I was considering legal action (another mistake, I soon realized). 

I was sitting pretty, I felt. I was keeping my nose clean and waiting for the severance offer. I even called a meeting with my team to warn them that the company would do anything to get rid of us long-termers on the cheap.  Don't give them an excuse, I said. Little did I know, I already had... 
  
Because I was so bored all the time I was spending more and more time on Reddit. On one occasion, about two months before this kicked off, I came across a big discussion about a product that I knew a fair bit about. So I joined the conversation, defending the product and explaining that, based on some meetings I‚Äôd attended with this company, the product is going to be way better than these guys realize by the time it gets released to the public. 
    
So a few days after the initial job-change meeting, I get invited to another meeting, and on this occasion my manager pulls out some print outs featuring comments from my Reddit account. It turned out that the company who were developing the product regularly searched Reddit for stuff about them, had seen what I‚Äôd said, gone through five years worth of comments and figured out where I worked. They then compared it to their NDA lists and identified me as the likely culprit. They said I was under NDA and shouldn‚Äôt be commenting on any of their products on social media. Which, frankly, was entirely fair of them. 
  
Normally, this wouldn‚Äôt have been a huge deal. My old managers would have slapped me about and then told senior management it was taken care of. But those guys were long gone, and the management I now answered to really didn't like me or my team, and wanted to save $200k a year by getting rid of us. 
  
The Reddit comment was positive and didn‚Äôt reveal any secrets, so this company were keen for me to delete it and leave it at that, but my employer saw an opportunity to avoid paying my severance, and launched a full investigation - but they sucked at investigating, and were unable to conclusively prove I‚Äôd written any comments at all (they didn‚Äôt even ask to see my company laptop). 
  
But they tried. They found all sorts of comments from several accounts that they tried to attribute to me, but none of it stuck (and most of them had nothing to do with me, the guy investigating really didn't understand Reddit at all). The investigation lasted for nearly three months (on full pay) and my lawyer eventually advised me to sue. So the company had to offer me a settlement or face the whole thing going to court. 
  
I wanted to go through with the legal action as we all knew it was a witch hunt by now, but I was acutely aware that if they found evidence that I used that Reddit account, I would be on shaky ground. Friends and family convinced me to take the offer, so I accepted it and moved on with life, albeit about $20k down overall. 
  
TL:DR - I fucked up by posting about work on Reddit, my employer used it to try and fire me, I lost out on severance package, recovered some of it by threatening to sue. ",tifu,TIFU by posting on Reddit

"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP.",legaladvice,A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the best exclusive games for the PS4 and one of the best games in 2018 so far. Its world has managed to surprise us due to the huge amount of content it possesses as well as because of its funny and deep gameplay. Finally, its visual level is movie-like and keeps the player engaged by means of a great story.

**Critical Hit** - Darryn Bonthuys - [9 / 10.0](https://www.criticalhit.net/review/marvels-spider-man/)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man is charming and energetic, action-packed and surprisingly capable of tugging on your heart strings to deliver a one-two punch to the emotional gut. If you had to sum up Marvel's Spider-Man in one word, nothing would be more apt than‚Ä¶amazing.

--------------

**Daily Dot** - AJ Moser - [4.5 / 5 stars](https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/marvel-spider-man-game-review/)

&gt;Every prominent character featured comes across as a natural fit for the world Insomniac have built, as well as Marvel's detailed history. In a similar way, this feels like the most authentic Spider-Man game that's ever been made. It captures every aspect of the hero and his secret identity that fans have come to love, all while delivering a lengthy experience that feels like a childhood dream of defying gravity finally come to fruition.

--------------

**Daily Mirror** - JC Suttun - [5 / 5 stars](https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/spider-man-ps4-review-marvels-13189735)

&gt;With a fresh take on the character in both story terms and gameplay, Insomniac have delivered a superb experience that harks back to when Rocksteady revitalised Batman with Arkham Asylum.
&gt;
&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man is a brilliant, thoroughly needed entry in the superhero genre that is a must play whether you're a hardcore comics fan, casual Spidey aficionado or simply a lover of action adventures.

--------------

**Destructoid** - Chris Carter - [9 / 10.0](https://www.destructoid.com/review-spider-man-519782.phtml)

&gt;Spider-Man isn't just a great superhero game, it's a proof of concept for Insomniac as a company. This project shows that they can basically handle pretty much any universe, because if you can accurately recreate Peter Parker's nimbleness and gentle heart you can do anything: and with multiple teasers at the end, I think they'll get that chance.

&gt;Insomniac Games has given us Spider-man on a scale he's never faced before. They've crammed their story full of surprises, with multiple villains to bring down, and a set of trusted friends and tricky gadgets to even the odds. Will this big-budget re-telling of Spidey in his prime connect with fans? *Review Copy Provided by PlayStation

**EGM** - Josh Harmon - [9 / 10.0](http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review/)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man mixes the prestige ambitions of a Sony exclusive with the hyperkinetic fun of a great superhero game. It's not a pairing you'd expect to work, but it mostly does here, though some aspects of the open-world design, like repetitive side content, let down the overall package.

--------------

**Eurogamer** - Christian Donlan - [Recommended](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-09-04-marvels-spider-man-review)

&gt;Clocking in at around 30 hours to complete Spider-Man's main storyline, and more if you decide to go after everything else the game has to offer, Spider-Man for PS4 isn't just triumph for video games. It's quite possibly the definitive interpretation of the superhero in any medium.

**Game Informer** - Andrew Reiner - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.gameinformer.com/review/spider-man/spinning-an-amazing-web)

**Game Revolution** - Jason Faulkner - [4 / 5 stars](https://www.gamerevolution.com/review/426589-spider-man-ps4-review-my-spidey-senses-are-tingling)

&gt;Spider-Man PS4 continues the awesome tradition we've seen emerge in the last decade or so of amazing licensed games. I wasn't a huge fan of some of the more repetitive side activities, but I had a lot of fun in general and gained a new appreciation of Spider-Man, enough so that I'll be checking out the comics when I get the time.

--------------

**Gameblog** - Julien Inverno - *French* - [7 / 10](http://www.gameblog.fr/tests/3141-marvel-s-spider-man-ps4)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man offers adrenaline rushes but also some free falls. If the incarnation of the Spider is breathtaking in this great playground that is New York, it is legitimate to hope a plot and more inspired missions while the formula is copied and pasted from recent Batman games. Spider-Man PS4 is solid and generous, but it lacks daring and originality.

--------------

**GameMAG** - xtr - *Russian* - [7 / 10](https://gamemag.ru/reviews/spider-man-2017)

&gt;The new Spider-Man features an incredibly beautiful open world, dull bosses and repetitive tasks. This project will amaze you with its visual quality, but, on the other hand, may dissapoint you with monotonous gameplay.

&gt;With the speed, agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid, Insomniac brings back the beloved super hero with a game that lacks novelty, but shines in every aspect. Marvel's Spider-Man is amazing, spectacular, sensational and superior to any other wall-crawling, web-slinging video game.

**IGN** - Jonathon Dornbush - [8.7 / 10.0](http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/04/marvels-spider-man-ps4-review)

&gt;I wanted Marvel's Spider-Man on PS4 to make me feel like Spider-Man: To sail between the highrises of New York City, to nimbly web up hordes of enemies, and tussle with familiar, animal-themed villains. Insomniac Games' first foray into the world of Marvel handily delivers on all of that. But what I didn't expect from Spider-Man was to come away feeling just as fulfilled to have inhabited the life of Peter Parker. Aside from a few odd pacing issues, which momentarily took me out of the experience of being a superhero, and a world of optional missions that don't always quite live up to the heft of the main story, Insomniac has delivered a Spider-Man story that both surprised and delighted me, coupled with gameplay that made me feel like Spider-Man nearly every step of the way. The Wall Crawler's open world doesn't consistently deliver the thrilling moments of its main campaign, but the foundation laid here is undoubtedly a spectacular one.

&gt;Probably the best Spider-Man game ever done, but still far from being perfect. Insomniac has made an excellent sandbox but its repetitiveness and some technical issues makes this game a bit less stellar.

--------------

**Just Push Start** - Grant E. Gaines - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.justpushstart.com/2018/09/marvels-spider-man-review/)

&gt;Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man isn‚Äôt perfect, but that doesn‚Äôt stop it from being a fantastic experience. The story takes a while to get going but the end is more than worth the wait. Add in a fun, fluid and flashy combat system and it makes for a delightful journey. Sure, at times it drags, like during the forced stealth sections, but these are not enough to ruin the experience. Between all these things, fantastic graphics, a good selection of costumes and more, I can not suggest Marvel‚Äôs Spider-Man enough. Even if you‚Äôre like me and not the biggest Spider-Man fan, it‚Äôs a good enough experience to make it worth your time.

**Kotaku** - Ethan Gach - [No Verdict](https://kotaku.com/spider-man-the-kotaku-review-1828796781)

&gt;As a playground for one of the most idiosyncratic superheroes of all time, Marvel's Spider-Man is sheer bliss. It's a sandbox platformer first and foremost, and a damn good one. Throughout playing the game I was constantly hounded by the question of whether this‚Äîsublime superhero traversal in a gorgeous, idealized version of New York‚Äîwere enough. After countless hours later spent cleaning up every last icon on the map, I'm convinced they are.

&gt;Spider-Man from Insomniac is for games what Homecoming is for movies. A piece of great game with amazing graphics. Fans of Man-Spider will be ecstatic. The others will be delighted with the quality of the whole game. Strong contender for GOTY.

**New Game Network** - Alex Varankou - [83 / 100](http://www.newgamenetwork.com/article/2002/marvels-spiderman-review/)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man combines exciting traversal mechanics, varied combat, great presentation and plenty of content to build up enough momentum and swing by the underwhelming story and boss battles without getting caught in a web.

**Next-Gen Gaming Blog** - Ben Ward - [9 / 10.0](https://www.nextgenbase.com/spider-man-review/)

&gt;Overall, Spider-Man is the game that a lot of people hoped it would be. An incredible traversal system that will have ironically been protoyped on a competitor‚Äôs exclusive title, a franchise with instant mainstream appeal and a story that, without giving anything away, sets things up nicely for a sequel without feeling lacking, all combine to make Spider-Man a must-play for 2018.

**Pittsburgh Post-Gazette** - Max Parker - [8.8 / 10.0](http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/the-game-guy/item/41477-spider-man-for-ps4-review)

&gt;This is the Spider-Man we know and love, but so much so that it's to a fault. ""Spider-Man"" for PS4 does more than enough to make comic fans and webhead fans happy. It clears the middling bar for Spider-Man games. It's the best Spider-Man game ever made. But, its uninspired narrative keeps it from reaching the heights of the ""Arkham"" series. Admittedly, that's a tough series to top. This is just the beginning for this new vision of Spider-Man and his journey, and his best tales may be waiting around the corner.

**PlayStation LifeStyle** - Chandler Wood - [9 / 10.0](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2018/09/04/marvels-spider-man-ps4-review/)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man doesn't innovate on the open-world genre, but Insomniac doubled down on creating a spectacular Spider-Man fantasy. It simply feels good to travel through Peter Parker's New York as the webslinger, even if whatever Spidey-suit you choose is covering a competent and entirely expected open-world formula. Filled with more emotion, heart, and humanity than we've seen in superhero adventures before, Insomniac doesn't need to reinvent the open-world wheel.¬†Marvel's Spider-Man embraces the man behind the mask and gives us the best interactive Spider-Man experience to date.

**PlayStation Universe** - John-Paul Jones - [9.5 / 10.0](https://www.psu.com/reviews/ps4-spider-man/)

&gt;A welcome return for PlayStation's original superhero icon, Insomniac Games have not just given us another sublime PlayStation exclusive but also the best superhero blockbuster the PS4 has ever seen. Spider-Man is a thunderous, essential triumph that bleeds cinematic splendor from every digital pore. Every PS4 owner needs to have Spider-Man in their collection.

**Press Start** - Brodie Gibbons - [10 / 10](https://press-start.com.au/reviews/playstation4-reviews/2018/09/05/spider-man-review-ps4/)

&gt;It's hard to fault Marvel's Spider-Man as Insomniac has taken their game to the next level. As a developer, they have gone from strength to strength and Spider-Man is a culmination of their past hits. There's a stunning verticality that compliments the game's watertight mechanics and, despite the literal boundaries, still makes the city seem boundless. If you're a Marvel die-hard, there's enough fanfare here to sink a ship as Spider-Man emerges as the new gold standard. Spider-Man is, without question, the best superhero game ever.

**Push Square** - Glen Fox - [9 / 10](http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/marvels_spider-man)

&gt;Ultimately, Marvel's Spider-Man is a must-buy, because no matter how you feel about our webbed superhero, this is just an insanely fun game to play, and it's¬†so well put together. Just like the Arkham games did for Batman, this pretty much provides the definitive version of the Spider-Man universe outside of the comics, and leaves us begging to explore more of it in the inevitable sequel. Webslinging is bliss, combat is fantastic¬†fun, and the extra content and collectibles are varied and infrequent enough not to overwhelm. What's more, the plot and characters are an unexpected surprise, with some fantastic performances that are genuinely touching. Marvel's Spider-Man is one of the best games of 2018 so far, and every PS4 owner will feel proud to own it as part of their library.

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man does a spectacular job of making you feel like the ultimate Spider-Man. From swinging through the city at high speed to fighting off legions of enemies by zipping between them and pulling them into the air, its gameplay looks like a scene from the films. It's remarkably well realised in terms of its world, design, and even technically, with short loading times and a rock solid framerate even on the base PlayStation 4.

**USgamer** - Mike Williams - [4.5 / 5 stars](http://www.usgamer.net/articles/spider-man-review)

&gt;Insomniac Games takes Marvel's most popular character for a spin and the results are fantastic. The developer establishes its own Spider-Man with a unique supporting cast and a beautiful recreation of New York to play around in. This is an absolutely beautiful game, with solid combat and a great story. Most of all, it really sells the feeling of being Spider-Man. The gaming history of Spider-Man has been uneven, but this is an amazing entry in that history. Pun intended.

**VG247** - Alex Donaldson - [undefined](https://www.vg247.com/2018/09/04/spider-man-review-ps4-marvel/)

&gt;Spider-Man is at its best when you're mid-flow. It's a game that can capture that awesome trance-like feeling where you're so in tune with the rhythm of swinging and hopping between buildings or dodging, countering and attacking enemies that everything else melts away. That's when it feels most special, and it's then that what Insomniac has achieved here is most plain. Much of its design is familiar, but it appears here in a refined, polished form that makes it an easy recommendation.

**VGN** - Giovanni Marrelli - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10.0](https://www.vgn.it/recensione/71064/marvels-spider-man-ps4/)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man is definitely the best game about one of the most beloved character in the comics history, but despite the great efforts of developer Insomniac Games, the new adventure is not perfect, especially when it comes to boss fights, which follow the same pattern over and over, and the quality and variety of the side contents, which tend to be boring after a while. It's a shame, because the combat system and the swinging are two of the best aspects of the game, and the team should have focus on creating more original and complex side adventures, quests and activities to take advantage of the biggest features of Marvel's Spider-Man.

**Worth Playing** - Redmond Carolipio - [9.3 / 10.0](http://worthplaying.com/article/2018/9/4/reviews/110793/)

&gt;Marvel's Spider-Man does what a lot of good art does, which is examine techniques and concepts that work well, and then blend and refine them to create something unique to itself and possibly greater. I've made this point before: Art and artists have built on and inspired each other since the beginning of time. So yes, I've heard and seen the Spidey/Arkham hot takes, and I ended up not caring at all because at no point did I forget I was playing a Spider-Man experience. I was too busy swinging around in Manhattan, with buildings whipping by as I tailed a police pursuit, thinking about how right it all felt.

**ZTGD** - Ken McKown - [9 / 10.0](http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/spider-man-ps4/)

&gt;Spider-Man is yet another outstanding title in Sony's first party library. PS4 owners should not hesitate to snag it when it drops. The quality they put into these titles is impressive and Insomniac continues to prove they can deliver on big-budget titles. Even with its minor gripes I still thoroughly enjoyed my time with Spidey and the gang. Perhaps we will see another one in the years to come, but for now this is the best our web-slinger has been since the early days of the PS2 era.

If there's one thing that NBA fans worldwide can (hopefully) agree upon, it's that Ben Simmons' first season in the league was nothing short of fantastic.

After being selected first overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, and further missing that full season due to injury, Simmons debuted this season and dominated, averaging 15.8ppg, 8.1rpg, and 8.2apg. Take into account that he did all this without any semblance of a jumpshot within his game and it continues to impress. Regardless of whether Simmons was a ‚Äòtrue‚Äô rookie in the season past, he seems destined for a bright future in the NBA.

Simmons was the key playmaker on the young Philadelphia 76ers squad, where he led them to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, finishing with a 52-30 record. This was also their first playoffs appearance in the last 6 years ‚Äì not bad for a rookie. He excelled running the team‚Äôs offense, racking up dimes across the season for a total of 661 ‚Äì good for 3rd place in the entire NBA. He was comfortable in his game all-around, getting his boards and points to respectable tallies. For a long while, it seemed as though ‚ÄòThe Process‚Äô was complete.


**Exposure in the Playoffs**

Simmons and the 76ers were, however, exposed in the semi-finals of the playoffs by their newfound Eastern Conference rival ‚Äì the Boston Celtics. They did what many teams had tried to do all year, and found a way to semi-stifle Ben Simmons‚Äô offensive game with what is possibly the simplest tactic of all time. They gave him space. And when I say they gave him space, I mean they gave him SPACE, which inevitably led to THIS.

https://imgur.com/a/5D1uxuI

I can‚Äôt remember a time when any NBA team disrespected a player on defence in such a way since the[ Spurs played Hack-a-Shaq 5 seconds into the 2008 season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S_soY5Jg_Q). Even then, that was a joke by Popovich.

[As you can see in ESPN's stats](https://imgur.com/a/TqrBt5h), during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals, Simmons was held to only 1 point. It's nothing to be entirely worried about, although it's definitely worth noting. This was his first season in the league, and his first true exposure to high-stakes competition, something he didn't reach at LSU. To expect a rookie to have to carry teams with 30+ point performances night-in-night-out shows how much we, as viewers, have become acclimatised to the ability of the likes of LeBron James.

[In this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/97g7ae/oc_worst_playoff_performances_by_notable_rookies/), it's evident that many notable rookies experience similar struggles at some point. Even the Celtics' Tatum had a 4pt game this year; see also, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony circa. 2004.

[Take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUJdHh9a1Ok) at how Simmons scored his 16 points, though, in Game 3 - immediately following his 1pt performance:

* A mismatch in the post, where he's now 1-on-1 against Rozier (an 8 inch advantage). He goes around him and finishes.
* Goes around Morris who is slow off reading a screen and finishes with a right-hand layup just in front of Horford.
* Finishes around Ojeleye in transition.
* Comes around a screen from Embiid and fakes out Baynes, finishing with an awkward floater/layup on his right.
* Lob on transition from Reddick.
* Hits an exceptionally awkward looking left-handed fadeaway over Horford in the paint.
* Hesitates and pull-ups for a fade in the paint.
* Spins around his defender for a layup.

It's worth noting that Boston didn't give him quite as much space as in Game 2. Compare that to [THIS play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=58&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU) during Game 2.

Horford immediately drops deep and allows Simmons space. Yes, he does get the pass off to Saric who drains the shot - but the principle is right. In fact, if you keep watching the video, you'll see just how effective Boston's tactics were; cutting passing lanes, allowing Simmons space, spying on movement, and doubling down low.

This isn‚Äôt to say that it‚Äôs a make or break situation for Philly; Ben Simmons, regardless of whether he‚Äôs given space or not has shown that he is capable of getting to the rim and finishing ‚Äì particularly from broken play. He also has phenomenal court vision, and an ability to find any open man as soon as they lace up and step on the court. You see, it's not that Ben Simmons is able to be completely nullified and will never score points again; **it's that Boston managed to find a way that neutralises many of his half-court threats, and this impacts heavily on the structure and flow of the 76ers' offense.**

**The Boston Defence**

Stopping Simmons using the style of defence applied by the Celtics also requires a very versatile, switchable defensive scheme, and an effective set of players ‚Äì something that few teams in the league have at their disposal. [Boston defends in a very similar manner to Golden State](http://www.nba.com/article/2018/05/15/boston-celtics-switching-defense-pays-dividends-2018-playoffs) ‚Äì a heavy usage of switching. When you look at the Celtics squad, they have a group of interchangeable wings that can easily switch assignment without having to face too much of a deficit, plus the access of a premier defender in Marcus Smart. Al Horford is also crucial in this regard, as his pure ability to read the defense and play smart basketball is what gives the Celtics an edge. To top it all off, you have by far one of the best coaches in the league in Brad Stevens, who reads the game unlike many others. Stevens actually said that [he runs a more ‚Äòposition-less‚Äô squad](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2720250-brad-stevens-says-celtics-have-3-not-5-positions-now), which is what helps the effectiveness of this system. With the use of ‚Äòball-handlers‚Äô, ‚Äòwings‚Äô, and ‚Äòbigs‚Äô, there is room for interchange.

Here's a look at how the Celtics could line-up this coming season.

First Unit:
* Ball Handler - Kyrie Irving

* Wing - Jaylen Brown

* Wing - Jayson Tatum

* Wing - Gordon Hayward

* Big - Al Horford

Bench unit:
* Ball Handler - Terry Rozier

* Wing - Marcus Smart

* Wing - Semi Ojeleye

* Wing - Marcus Morris

* Big - Aron Baynes

That's a REALLY versatile defensive lineup.

What I would expect to see from other less-capable defensive teams is the key lessons more so than the specific scheme ‚Äì give him space, cut passing lanes, and limit transition opportunities. Now evidently Simmons' teammates will still have a good chance of hitting their shots; they're professional basketballers playing in the best league in the world. But, this strategy is about limiting their effectiveness, Simmons' distribution, and disrupting the offense.

Something to really consider is that[ Simmons averaged the second-most offensive touches during the 2017-18 regular season](https://stats.nba.com/players/touches/?sort=TOUCHES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2017-18&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612755), losing to only Russell Westbrook. Simmons‚Äô 95.0 touches per game increase to 104.6 touches during the 76ers playoff run, almost 6 more touches than LeBron per game, and more than Westbrook.

When you take into account such a high volume of touches, it‚Äôs clear that he truly is the core facilitator in the Philadelphia squad ‚Äì the next highest was Embiid at 76.4 (76.6 in the playoffs). This is also the core of the issue. If your main facilitator is unable to play his normal style of game, get passes to the right place, get his shots off, and the opposition is able to spy on offensive movement, your team won‚Äôt run as well as it should. Simmons is essentially unable to adapt his game to the Boston defense, due to the fact that he can‚Äôt generate any respect as a shooting threat.

**Simmons and Shooting**

Similarly, Simmons cannot be relied upon to drain high-percentage looks down the stretch. Even if Simmons were to remain on the court during clutch situations, and acted as the primary ball-handler, his odds of getting a successful go-ahead bucket are limited. Switch this idea, having Simmons on the court but not handling the ball, and you simply have one less player that the defense has to worry about on a catch-and-shoot situation, meaning that they are able to better focus their defensive energies to threats.

[Look again at this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=255&amp;v=tb4XmzPu7zU). Late in the fourth-quarter, Simmons really can't do much to help the team in this situation as the main playmaker. Embiid ends up pulling up from three, and Saric gets the second-chance points.

Yes, you could play Simmons down on the low-block in these situations as a lob threat and crashing the offensive glass ‚Äì but that‚Äôs a bit insulting to your players with the league-high touches per game, no? Regardless, Simmons' low-post game is nowhere near developed enough to be a respectable threat - unless it's a mismatch (see the Rozier mismatch above), and his off-ball movement is generally above Westbrook-level, but not enough to create a huge threat.

Another potential threat to the Sixers is the prospect of Hack-a-Simmons. During the regular season, he shot **56% on 4.2 attempts/game**. Although this increased to 70% during the playoffs on a much smaller sample size, the question remains: Do you risk keeping on your main offensive threat in these late-game situations, when:

* He‚Äôs a risk of being sent to the line?
* He‚Äôs clearly struggling to generate points in a half-court offense?
* You‚Äôre facing a team with a good interior defender, and a switch-heavy defense, allowing him space and negating part of the offensive flow?

Let‚Äôs take a theoretical situation where Philly decides to take Simmons OUT of the lineup during the final three minutes of a playoff game. You‚Äôre now missing the remainder of Simmons‚Äô 104 touches, and they have to be moved somewhere. Therefore, one of your other players has to step in and run the offense. The natural solution is either:

1. The reserve PG (T.J. McConnell) steps in and runs it as per previously
2. ISO every play with your most efficient scorer (Embiid - 0.82pts per ISO possession, on 1.6 possessions per game).

The first option is much less intimidating to the defensive team; no disrespect to T.J. McConnell (for whom I have a huge soft spot), but his playmaking is below-par in comparison to Simmons. The second option, as scary as it may seem, is not justifiable for long-stretches of game time. Embiid is a great scorer, but against a good defensive centre, not only is he going to get tired, but defenders will adapt.

Simply said, Ben Simmons NEEDS to develop some form of a shooting stroke. At the very minimum, a respectable FT percentage to allow him to stay on the court during late-game situations. If he doesn‚Äôt do so, then the 76ers need an adequate replacement.

**Wrong Hand Woes**

On the topic of Simmons‚Äô shooting, Kevin O‚ÄôConnor (Writer for The Ringer - shoutout u/KevinOConnorNBA love your work and hope you enjoy this), is ADAMANT that he uses the wrong hand for shooting.

In a recent interview with Fox Sports, Simmons was asked about whether even he knows which hand of his is more dominant, to which he replied, ‚ÄúYou come to the gym. I‚Äôm gonna work out when I‚Äôm in Melbourne. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù As cryptic as that may be, he continued when prodded to say, ‚ÄúIn the NBA you‚Äôve gotta play to what your strengths are. I never had real chances of just shooting. I never played in a year where I had to develop my shooting, because I was always better than most of the guys I played. Even this season without the jumper I was able to nearly have a triple-double every game.‚Äù

On the topic of whether developing shooting will be something he looks into in the near future, he said, ‚ÄúIt just depends where I wanna be later in life. I can be satisfied with 15/8/8, or if I wanna be at that next level and be an all-star, then I add something to my game.‚Äù

[Here's Simmons hitting a nice-looking right-hand hook shot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUN4rYSekYg)

In comparison, [here's a shot Simmons took left-handed during a pre-season workout.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=130&amp;v=ihyFtqYng5s)

See the difference? Nobody knows for sure, but it's something Simmons himself needs to establish.

**The Impact of Respect**

To wrap this all up, let‚Äôs take a look at what the Boston defence may look like should Simmons develop some form of shooting stroke.

If Ben Simmons would even attempt proper three-pointers during games, you may find that the space between himself and a defender like Horford may slowly shrink. Hell, even Marcus Smart, arguably one of the worst decent-volume shooters in the league, is taking open threes, shooting at a measly 29.3% career clip - at 4.2 attempts per game.

Below are some edited glimpses into how the defense could look if Simmons' developed any resemblance to a perimeter threat - taken from the original image above.

3pt% = 15-20

https://imgur.com/a/ETAkBoG
3pt% = 25

https://imgur.com/a/9AUT2VJ
3pt% = 30

This seemingly insignificant increase in space, caused by the increased respect for Simmons' genuine threat of a half-decent jumpshot changes the entire dynamic of the defense that the 76ers will face.

**Conclusion**

To reiterate, the downside is that the teams capable of providing such a defensive impact are few and far between in the current NBA, as it requires such a diverse lineup and widespread talent, plus solid coaching. During the regular season, there is also MUCH less time for these teams to focus on implementing defensive game-plans simply for one team; it‚Äôs during the coming playoffs that we‚Äôll largely see whether franchises choose to adapt to such a style, and if so, then personally I find it hard to see Philly going too much further than this season without a solid replacement and/or third-scoring option (looking at you Fultz).

Regardless, I believe that this coming season we‚Äôll see Ben Simmons still have a great follow-up to his rookie year ‚Äì at least statistically. He‚Äôs evidently one of the most talented offensive players that the league has seen, with an unreal feel and read of the game. Will the Sixers manage to make it through a balanced eastern conference this year, with a strong Celtics squad and defensively-improved Raptors, amongst others?

""A chance encounter with one of the coolest 86 owners I‚Äôve ever met!

Popped down to the shops for milk &amp; came across this 86, it‚Äôs owner happened to be returning to it at the same time.

Meet Marie. She bought this sprinter brand new in 1983 &amp; has owned it since. When she purchased it she knew it would be the only car she‚Äôd ever buy, 35 years later it‚Äôs still her daily driver. 
She drove it across the Nullarbor from Tasmania to WA &amp; in her 35 years of ownership it only broke down on her once &amp; she cried when it was put on the tow truck! 

She is very particular about it‚Äôs maintenance, with one mechanic looking after it for her all it‚Äôs life. She mentioned she only uses genuine Toyota parts except for when her air con broke she had to get a spurious motor which she wasn‚Äôt too happy about!! She adored her 86 &amp; it really showed, the car was immaculate inside and out. She told me she gets inundated with guys following her around offering her big money for the car but she will never ever sell it. We chatted for a while and she enjoyed hearing about my corolla too. 

An absolute lady and huge 86 enthusiast! People are meant to cross paths for a reason I guess, Marie you are one of a kind &amp; I was so fortunate to meet you. 

Truly my pleasure. Legend!‚ù§Ô∏è #ae86 #toyota #respect""",cars,This lovely lady bought a new AE86 in 1983 and has been driving it ever since.

"I presume the answer will be no. So I'll turn it into more what-if question:

There was recently news article about a company that stored energy using big blocks of cement which they pulled up to store energy and let fall down to release it again. Lets consider this is a perfect system without any energy losses. 

How much would the energy needed and energy restored differ if we took into account position of them Moon? Ie if we pulled the load up when the Moon is right above us and it's gravity 'helps' with the pulling and vice versa when it's on the opposite side of Earth and helps (or atleast doesn't interfere) with the drop. 

I know the effect is probably immeasurable so how big the block would need to be (or what other variables would need to change) for a Moon to have any effect? Moon can move oceans afterall. ",askscience,Can we use Moons gravity to generate electricity?

"Reading through the comments on that post about the Minecraft coins and it‚Äôs frustrating to see the unabashed ignorance of the situation. Are we intentionally ignoring the fact that the old console editions and Pocket Edition (back before it became Bedrock Edition) all allowed purchasing of the exact type of features the Bedrock marketplace lets you purchase now? They were selling skin packs, resource packs, and the mashup packs that included a matching set of skins + a resource pack + a map for things like Halo, Mass Effect, etc. 

I‚Äôm not saying you have to like microtransactions but people find any opportunity they can to bash MS and call doomsday against Java Edition. Let‚Äôs be very clear about the situation though: The microtransactions are being handled well whether you like them or not (they‚Äôre only for cosmetics and they benefit and enable content creators), Minecraft has pretty blatantly improved dramatically content-wise in the past few years (mending, elytra, shulker boxes, 1.13 in its entirety), and the Java game dev team has MORE THAN DOUBLED in size, indicating the complete opposite of the death of Java Edition being desired by them, in the cards, or part of the foreseeable future. 

You‚Äôre completely entitled to your opinion on microtransactions but it‚Äôs pointless and really just incorrect fear mongering to slam down and herald the desired end of Java Edition in posts like that.

"So this story is actually about a year old, but I remembered it the other day and decided to post it.

Now for a little backstory. I was 26, in-the-closet trans, depressed, and still entirely dependant on my parents for everything. I worked for my dad. I rented a room in my dad's rental house. My parents co-signed my loan on my car. I was securely under my thumb, and they used that to their advantage.

I had a bad habit of not getting out of bed when my alarm went off. Depression is a bitch. And this morning was like any other at this point. Laying in bed at 9AM, after I was supposed to be up at 7AM. Understandably, my dad is angry, and as he has a key to the rental, busts through my door. I really didn't wanna hear it, so I pretended to be asleep.

What followed was the longest, most painful 30 minutes of my life. Apparently I'm terrible at pretending to be asleep, or my dad is terrible at realizing I'm actually awake. He said he knew I was awake, but I still don't know if I believe him. I don't remember what he said, but a few things stuck out to me.

""Your friends are fake, they don't care about you.""

""You are not a transvestite."" (Of course I'm not, that's something different entirely. Validation, yay.)

""I declare death and destruction on those who would misled you."" (Did I mention my parents were religious?)

***""You need to cut these toxic people out of your life.""***

Oh boy, did I take that last bit to heart. I contacted all of my gaming friends to see if any of them had a place I could stay, saved up, bought a bus ticket, and three months later, at midnight, February 1st, I was on a bus travelling ten hours to Houston, with nothing but three suitcases containing my essentials.

Apparently when my dad told me to cut the toxic people out of my life, he didn't realize that was him and my mom. According to my sister, they are not doing as good.

Careful what you preach, I guess.

EDIT: I did not expect this to have the type of response it has. I should probably clarify a few things.

I left because I was being controlled by the things my parents had provided for me. They were holding them over my head. My dad is less to blame for this than my mom is, she was the one that held them over my head.

My dad is not nearly as bad as my mom, and is doing much better. They've both accepted me now, but back then, my entire family was emotionally abusive without realizing it, with the exception of my dad.

They aren't doing much better now, and I am. I don't know the specifics, except my mom cheated on my dad (for the third time, twice within the year). They're supposedly in divorce proceedings now and she's trying to get everything.

My dad had closed down his business that I was working at a few months before I left, and I was helping him flip houses, which he was trying to get into doing. He had taken out a lot of loans, and is most surely in a lot of debt now.

To be honest, if anyone is at fault here, it's my mom. She's narcissistic, controlling, and was basically using my dad, and still is, AFAIK.",MaliciousCompliance,"""You need to cut the toxic people out of your life."""

"World quest addons still work. People are still using them. Blizzard cannot break them any further without taking away group finder altogether.

What we're left with is a worse group finder, especially for those who don't use addons.

It is now absolutely FULL of groups with names that are uninterpretable strings of numbers like ""54729, 53882, 51173"" and so on. This is because group finders now instruct users to type in the quest ID string as a quick way to communicate the group they're making to other addon users.

How can Blizzard nerf group finder addons to this current state and leave it like it is? Last expansion, these addons would make groups named after the quest, anyone could find and join in, but now it's just numbers. The group finder now has two sets of users who fundamentally cannot interact with each other. Addon users and non-addons users. This means less groups available to everyone.

"This was twenty years ago. My husband was stationed in Louisiana. Dh was/is a jock but he was/is also geeky like myself. He played all the squadron sports... all of them. 
I went along with him to most of his games and practices to let our son play with the other babies and to socialize with the other spouses. After we had been there for about a year we were assigned a new airman and his wife to sponsor, basically we helped them find an apartment and show them around town. 
We were happy to have new friends. They were similarly geeky but not at all athletic. My husband is super competitive but a good winner and decent loser. I frankly don't care if I win or lose until someone trips my bitch button then I'm going to do every possible to win, repeatly. The Airman and his wife were also super competitive they all had a baby shortly after we met them. 
Like I said DH is a jock, lettered in high school, All American in college, got a partial scholarship in an unusual sport. So of course DH would start on the squadron teams, preform well, ect. The Airman was not as physically blessed as DH and it ate at both of him and his wife.
They were horrible parents. They would leave a diaper on that poor kid until nearly burst. At every game, practice they went to she would leave the nast pant load behind our rear tire, our trunk or inside our car if the window was down.
They always left before us because DH alway helped clean up the after. 
After months of mysterious poopy diapers dumps. I caught her and the Airman laughing about putting shit in our car.They had just bought a new car with built in baby car seat that their baby wasn't big enough for. 
I hatched a plan. It was summer, in Louisiana so hot and muggy as hell. I got one of the other wives to distract the nasty pair after the wife changed a real nasty diaper and tucked it in my wheel well. They never locked their doors. They bragged about how no one would dare touch their car, or appartment. My bitch button was pushed, I dared. I took the toxic spawn waste and carefully placed it inside the build in car seat. 
It took them months to find it.

"I can't be the only one who felt how cute their relationship was, however brief it may have been. Krum is painted as this stoic, humourless character at first, but then we learn that he legitimately waited in the library to ask Hermione to the ball because he's too shy to interrupt her. If that wasn't adorable enough, he ended up making Hermione feel like a princess for a night, actually having nothing but pure interest in what she had to say. Must have been a new feeling to her.

I know the concept of the superstar falling for the cute, nerdy bookworm is cliche, but that doesn't stop it from being adorable here. Viktor in general is an underrated character. He's world famous but was always humble, millions of people learnt how to pronounce Hermione's name because of him and let's not forget that when the Triwizard champions were thinking up ways of surviving underwater for an hour, Krum decided to become a god damn badass shark. No simple gills for this boy.

I know some people take issue with the age gap between him and Hermione, but people forget that Hermione was actually 15 instead of 14 by that point. Plus it's no secret that Hermione is mature for her age; he probably felt like he was interacting with a young adult. Either way, if they had stayed together and let that minor issue not get in the way, just imagine how much ass they would kick as a married couple. It would be so brilliant. 

Oh and also, they sent each other letters. That's pretty perfect to me.",harrypotter,Did anyone else secretly hope for Hermione and Viktor to stay together?

"One college summer break 8 years ago my friends and I were bored. We remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""Solar Balloon"". This was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. The sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.  
  
We had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. We spent a few days driving around to Walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. Finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. After sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!  
  
[This is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.](https://imgur.com/1kMEbpm)
  
We had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
   
[Shortly after this the balloon got away from us](https://imgur.com/eJipKfQ)  
[Further](https://imgur.com/a/rUOxWCh)  
  
This was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. Shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. Oh well, mission success.  
  
A few years later [I happened across this news article](https://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/05/look_up_in_the_sky_its_a_large.html). The balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big UFO panic. People were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. Our boredom unintentionally created a UFO panic in central NJ. I moved out of the area but when I get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.  
  

EDIT: Wow didn't really think this would gain much traction. Also didn't expect any NJ Redditors to have seen this let alone the author of the article to show up. Glad everyone thinks this is funny but that being said please don't go out and do this on purpose.
