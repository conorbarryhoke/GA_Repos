"Dogs working because they love us, because we love them, and/or because they love to work.

Being a companion is a very important job, so don't feel left out because your dog doesn't work. All dogs are welcome in every Photo Friday thread. ",dogs,[Photo Friday] A Labor of Love
"For the September Trick of the Month, we’ll be teaching our dogs Find It. In this trick, they’ll be using their noses to find a hidden treat or toy, or even to identify the scented object between multiple identical looking objects! This game is great for mental stimulation and stress relief and can also be a very constructive activity for dogs struggling with reactivity!

​

Here's how it works:

1: Teach a dog the trick. Don't own a dog? Borrow your neighbors or grandmas dog, they'll be thrilled when you teach them cool things.

2: Film the dog performing the trick.

3: Upload video/picture

4: Post link to video or pictures in the results thread that will appear at the end of the month.

"Ok, she's actually a great dog; troublemaker might not be the right word. But my rescue border collie/shepherd/cattle dog mix has the energy of 3 dogs... so I'm a bit shocked with how well she did.

Last weekend a photographer spotted us on our daily walk and asked if she would be interested in a job! A client of hers was looking for a ""model"" to wear their product. In addition to keeping the products, she got $50 in gift cards to a local pet store - and better yet, I received copies of the photos! I was amazed with how well she cooperated - I told her to sit and she seemed to just smile right at the camera - take a look at some of the pics!

"I was told he's a Pitt/Lab mix and he looks like it, but I love people's reactions when I tell them he's a

Argentinian fish hound,
Finnish rat stalker,
Tanzanian wild dog mixed with golden retriever,
Swiss ridge walker,

Or whatever else pops in my mind at the time. Sometimes I throw in a little backstory about the breed. Almost nobody has tried to call bs. Once or twice even gotten a ""oh my friend has one of those."" No. Your friend does not have a Turkish water seeker.

"I came to his subreddit asking to learn about breeders and pure breads and to be lead away from doodles several months ago. You guys convinced me. I did further research and took all the tips into account and at the start of the summer we brought home a beautiful Portuguese Water Dog who’s 110% fluff and 120% personality. We love her very much. [here she is checking to see if mom’s book is any fun to play with!](https://m.imgur.com/a/5gb7ZQo)

We found an AKC registered breeder with a litter in the correct timeframe. She checked all the boxes - only has 1-2 litters a year. Shows/titles her dogs. Did all the appropriate health testing for the breed. Had a waiting list (but someone on the list wanted to wait for a later litter and we lucked out on our pup). Very thorough application process for us, with multiple interviews - by phone as she’s seven hours away. Hundred+ pages of new owner education we had to go through before pickup and even more we went home with. Even needed to prove income to show we’d be able to support puppy, and of course there was a takeback clause in contract if for any reason we ever couldn’t.

We bought pet insurance and all the equipment we could possibly need. We take her everywhere Nd treat her better than some people I know treat their human children. We followed all the “rules” in the puppy books for socializing, vaccinating, puppy classes, etc.

Puppy still has some kind of congenital issue. She can’t swallow food or water well. No one has been able to tell why. She drinks from a rabbit water bottle and is hand fed small bites of soft food like eggs, mulTiple times a day. She coughs constantly. Immediately after eating or drinking she coughs up whatever she attempted to get down, along with gastric juice and saliva. She’s had two sinus infections requiring heavy antibiotics from fluids/food backing up into her sinus cavities at not even five months old and has been at the vet’s on antibiotics and iv fluids since Friday morning - it’s now Monday afternoon. She has pneumonia. We visited today and she’s doing much better, is acting more herself and we hope she’ll be well enough to come home in a few days. She’s ten pounds behind her siblings in bodyweight due to her challenges with eating, even though she started out in the middle of the litter.

This probably should have been a vent post, but I wanted it to stay open for other experiences or advice. We’ve seen four vets. We’re seeing two different specialists when she pull through this pneumonia to see if they can tell us anything. We did and are doing everything we know to have done, but the thing we’ve learned with our princess is that there are no guarantees. Our girl is a fighter, and we’re going to keep fighting for her too as long as we can. But all we’ve learned so far is that even if you do everything the right way, things can still go wrong.

I was walking my dog earlier when I saw someone coming up the road with a bully type dog. He looked friendly, almost overtly so, straining and whining and all wiggles and goofiness, but I got a weird feeling and felt like I needed to cross the street. I stopped and started to cross, and the dog's owner called out ""It's okay! He's friendly!"" I called back ""Mine isn't,"" even though he is, just to be safe, and she started following us and calling ""Let them meet! It's okay, your dog looks sweet!"" Of course my corgi was bouncing and happy-barking, making me look like a liar, so against my better judgment I stopped trying to cross because it was so awkward trying to get away from this lady.

She walked up to us and all of a sudden completely lost control of her dog. He barreled at mine, grabbed him by the harness and starting shaking him. I'm yelling, my dog is crying, chaos everywhere. He would not let go of my dog no matter how much I punched and kicked him. Fortunately he had my dog by the handle of his harness, and when the harness popped off, my dog got free and ran (almost getting hit by a car). She was able to hold her dog back while I caught mine, we exchanged information, I took him straight to the vet and he's going to be fine. Just has some abrasions and bruising from the harness.

I feel like the biggest idiot. I had such a bad feeling about meeting the other dog and must have somehow gotten a subconscious cue from his body language. Please, if your gut is telling you another dog is bad news for yours, listen to it even if the dog SEEMS friendly. Because I almost lost my dog today. Your instincts very well might be right.

"Hi Everyone, 

to give you all a bit of context, my husband and I have an almost 11 years old pure breed Newfoundlander. We've had him since he was 9 weeks and he has been the most wonderful companion we could ever ask for...minus for the many health issues. For a quick summary: he has been dealing with serious skin problem since he was approximately 6 months and this has been an ongoing issue at least 6x a year. He also got a knee surgery at 2yo, then another surgery around 5 for a lump on his paw, he got diagnosed with a cancerous lump on his neck at 8 yo which they completely removed and he has been in remission since and for the past 6 months now, we've noticed that he has a lot of difficulty getting up and he has been dragging his legs more and more...we've also noticed that he's panting loudly by just getting up but yet, he has never complained. The vet saw him every month for the past year and at our last visit, she confirmed that even though his blood tests are fine, he is declining and last month she brought up how she is seeing his quality of life declining and we should start preparing ourselves. We know it's coming, but we don't know how far we should go. We always said: ""When Pablo won't be able to do what he loves: going for walks, for rides and going up the stairs, we'll know it's time!"" Well at this point, he can't go for walks anymore, but if we would ask him to go, he would gladly go and push himself to the max. Today I brought him for a ride and he got really excited but during the ride, I could see he was struggling standing up and he ended up just laying down between the 2 front seats. He's a newf so he has never been super active to begin with, but seeing him struggling with these simple things makes me terribly sad. I don't want him to become just a ""carpet"", but he still picks up his toys once in a while and will try to play tug with us. We've also tried pain medication for a month to see if we would notice a difference but nop, not really. 
People around us see the difference, and we do too, but it is really hard to make a final decision when he still shows some excitement for things he loves...even though he can't really enjoy them anymore. 

So here we are...seeing our perfect puppy slowly degrading and not knowing when it's time to let him go. I would like to know what would convince you it's time to let him go? 

Thank you for reading and giving me your opinion!",dogs,[Help] When do you know it is time to put down your companion?
"My Boston Terrier passed away 4 days after receiving a shot at the Vets on Weds. We're all shocked and upset but still uncertain the cause of the death.The emergency vet said she appeared to have some sort of liver disease. It doesn't make sense because the day before she went to the vet she was bringing me bouncy rubber ball to throw so she could fetch. She was hyper and full of energy. 

I miss her and I have a lot of regrets about taking her to the vet or not taking her to the emergency clinic sooner. I didn't get to see her the day she passed. My Mother told me she was with her as she took her last breath. I wish I could say it was instant but she fought for her life for 4 days. It sucks. My sister found her new years day wandering a neighborhood with her sister. She was able to capture them both and she offered me one of them. Over the years I had a special bond with her.

"I am raising my first puppy ever and I always feel like I'm worrying about doing the right thing. He is about 13-14 weeks now and to be honest he has been such a good boy.

We live in an apartment, so we are using pee pads right now. I know that not everyone agrees with it, but honestly it has prevented so many accidents. He goes on the pee pad I would say 55% of the time, 40% outside and I would say maybe 5% accidents. Accidents rarely happen, though, it has been a little over a week now since he's had one. I would like to take him outside more, to be honest, but we were told by our vet that parasites were really bad right now so we are mostly trying to keep him inside right now just to be safe. 

The biting was a little bit discouraging at first... I definitely got some pretty bad cuts from him, but I've been focusing on positive reinforcement, not getting frustrated, approaching him with toys and working on bite inhibition. He has improved a lot, though! And he is now starting to roll on his back for belly rubs with little to no biting. Now when he bites it's pretty gentle and if he starts to bite harder I just say gentle or ouch and he stops. 

When we first got him we received a lot of unsolicited advice about how to discipline him. I had done a LOT of research beforehand and I have never agreed with punishing a dog, especially a puppy. One coworker in particular stated I should do alpha rolling, which I completely disagree with. Instead I have been focusing on positive reinforcement and giving him lots and lots of treats. I mostly give him the dehydrated chicken and beef liver treats or a bit of his kibble. 

Training-wise he has been so eager to learn and please and I'm so proud whenever he gets down a new command. So far sit is super strong - basically anytime he wants anything now he will sit first. We also make sure to make him sit and stay before we give him his food. He also knows stay pretty well, down, come (still working on his recall), drop it, paw, and he now knows roll over! We're also working now on getting him to follow through commands in distracting environments and work on his recall. 

So far we haven't noticed any food/resource guarding. We put our hands in his food while he is eating, take away his toys and give it back (drop it/fetch) and he is not aggressive whatsoever. 

We have also been socializing him as much as possible. He has met so many people and is so friendly to them. He is surprisingly really good with kids as well! We have also introduced him to as many vaccinated dogs as possible and he is very good with them so far, too. He has not been aggressive at all.

Again, this is my first puppy and I feel like raising a dog is so stressful because you are the determining factor in how they act when they are older. I read a quote that one year of training is what determines if your dog is well behaved for a lifetime. I just wanted to go over what I have done so far and see if there is anything else I can be working on. I love this puppy so much and I would really do anything for him.

"Hi everyone,

My dog injured her nail while being boarded and was brought to my vet’s office, but was seen by a vet I’ve never met before. The vet claimed the nail wasn’t broken, only ground down (oddly, the only nail on that paw to have been “ground down”), and that’s why it was bleeding profusely. The nail was wrapped up and my dog was sent back to the boarding facility without pain meds or antibiotics.

Five days later, the boarder discovered that my dog’s injured nail was rotated. The vet was called again, said they didn’t have time to see her, and made an appointment for the following morning (17 hours later). So, the boarding facility took my dog to the emergency vet. The ER vet said her nail was likely broken from the initial incident, and had to remove the nail. My dog was then on crate rest for a week after, and her nail won’t grow back for a long time.

The vet (whose office my puppy has been going to since she was brought home), denied ever seeing my dog in the first place (later went back on this statement), denied the nail was broken when she was examined, and is refusing any reimbursement for the almost $400 ER vet bill. I don’t see how her nail couldn’t have been broken when she was initially seen, and my dog wouldn’t have had to go to the ER vet if her broken nail was initially treated. I feel reimbursement is appropriate. 

Has anyone here had an experience like this? I feel like there’s no possible way the broken nail was a separate incident from the “ground down” nail, especially since my dog’s paw was wrapped during that time and her activity was restricted. I know no one wants to admit to making a mistake, especially when it would cost their business money, but I have spent a great deal of money at this vet over the past year, and they’re adamant about not reimbursing anything from the emergency vet. To say I’m disappointed is a huge understatement. Does anyone have any advice?

"I'm incredibly interested in getting involved in the Lagotto Romagnolo breed within the next few years. I've been told that the best way to get into a breed is to contact a breeder and, basically, find myself a mentor who will lead me into the world of my chosen breed.

I think this is a fantastic idea for me, especially considering that fact that I'm not an experienced dog owner (I got my first dog a year ago) and, with a rarer breed such as the Lagotto, it might not be the right choice for me even if I adore them as deeply as I do. Rather than potentially buying a pup or dog and realising I'd made a mistake, I would much rather dip my toes into the water, so to speak.

Not only do I want to get into the Lagotto breed, I also want to get into the showing scene too. I love watching dog shows and, no matter what breed my future dogs will be, I feel like I'll be involved in them no matter what. I'm eager to learn EVERYTHING.

I think I've found a potential Lagotto person who'll take me one or who'll direct me towards someone who would take me on and I've decided to send her an email at the end of the month.

Now she lets me rub her belly, so obviously she’s very trainable! She’s currently 4 years old, and I couldn’t imagine life without her...

So let me tell you what happened today. 

Walking my dog has always been a chore, and I’ve had to work hard to get her used to being in a park setting. I have an electronic collar (the kind that plays a tone if the dog does something bad), and sometimes she has to have it or she just won’t act right. I’m talking jumping up on people, pulling, growling at nothing and everything, chasing bicycles, skateboarders, what have you (I know she sounds like a terrible dog). 

Lately, the neighbors have been gathering at the community pool and cooking out all day on weekends. My dog loves this and only wants to walk around the community pool now, because the neighbors love her and pet her and love on her and spoil her, but I think it’s starting to be detrimental to her behavior because the last few times I’ve tried to take her to the park (big dogs need long walks, and the neighborhood is not big enough for her daily exercise), she’s been stubborn and tried to turn towards the pool. 

Today was no exception. She didn’t want to get in the car, was doing her typical Pyrenees stand on the sidewalk, not budging, turning towards the pool, all of that. I finally got her in the car and took her to the park. I went with my mom, and when we were halfway through the park, my mom decided we needed to head back because it was too hot (American southern state, it was 90f and HUMID). I reasoned that it would be the same distance if we kept on and did the whole route, but my mom seems to have a little Pyrenees in her too and pointed out that we would be more in the shade if we turned. Not really, but I had already argued with the dog, i was hot and tired, and fine, we’ll go back the way we came. 

My dog did not like this. She wanted to continue. I did too. Mom was adamant, so I got behind my dog and started playfully “herding” her along. 

As we’re doing this, a couple was coming towards us. 

Keep in mind, my dog has gotten used to everyone in the world loving her, so she sees these people, and even though she doesn’t know them, she expects some sort of love and acknowledgment from them. She jumps on the guy and he loses it. I’m apologizing, my mom is apologizing, but he kept saying, “wow, that’s just great. Wow, that’s real nice!” His wife was saying something similar, “oh that’s just nice, isn’t it? God, that’s SOOO nice!” 

My mom is a nice person, I’m not. She was like, “I really am sorry.” I couldn’t believe they were being so rude. I stupidly said something like, “I guess dogs know who good people are, huh?” Because I’m an idiot. The guy goes nuclear at this point, dropping F-bombs, accusing my dog of attacking him, trying to bite him, he chased after us and got my license plate I think (he had his phone) and said he was calling the cops. I told him to go ahead. 

So I went to the police station right away (it abuts the park) and made a statement. The officer told me he doubted the people would do anything about it, but I’m still worried they’ll try to sue me or something. So my mom and I are at the station, which is part of the park, and they saw my mom go out of the station because you pass it if you’re on the walking trail in the park (I’m sorry if this is confusing), and these jokers start taunting my 72-year-old mother saying, “you’re getting arrested! They’re gonna Arrest you!” I was talking with the officer inside and she came back in and told him what they said, she was almost crying. The officer thankfully rolled his eyes and said that some people have big mouths. He still doubted they’d do anything. 

I can’t calm down, though. I keep thinking I’ve done something wrong with my dog. Why is she like this? She kept trying to jump on the officer, too, because he didn’t talk to or acknowledge her. He was thankfully okay with it, and said she was just being protective. 

I’m not sure what more to do with my dog. It seems that I always need to have her electronic collar on her, no matter what now. I feel like I can’t take her back to the park anymore. I just feel so defeated. This doesn’t feel like a step back, more like a leap. 

Also, I’ve never seen her jump on people like that. When she was younger she’d try to jump on them, but I got her out of that habit. She doesn’t jump on our neighbors, they’re all great and kneel down to talk to her and pet her. The whole thing was just out of character, and yet not out of the realm of possibility for her.

"# Introduction

Hi all, we're considering getting a dog next year and doing our research into what breeds might be a good fit. Our dream dogs are huskies and we'd love to have one, but we're not sure they're a good fit for our situation - would love advice on that and suggestions for any other alternative breeds that might be a good alternative. Thank you for your help :)

**1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

No - I used to have a Jack Russell, who was a bit of a handful due to lack of training and suitable care by his previous owner (they kept him inside a small flat 24/7 so he was scared of everything). He was wonderful with me, but could be anxious/overly protective and barked a lot at men and big dogs. I trained him as much as I could but I was young and inexperienced and I didn't know how to train him properly (nor did I have the money to take him to a trainer). Now that I am older and hopefully wiser, and in a much better financial situation, I am keen to make sure that we do the research and take the time to make sure that whatever dog we get is a good fit and well trained.

This will be my husband's first time owning a dog.

**2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/**[**http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**)?**

We would rather rescue if possible. We're leaning towards getting a dog that's 1-2 years old, rather than a very young puppy, due to not being able to be at home enough to look after a puppy.

**3)	Describe your ideal dog.**

A happy, playful dog that likes affection but is also willing to just chill sometimes. A dog we can take to social events and can be well behaved around other dogs &amp; children. Ideally fluffy, medium sized and wolfy looking :)

**4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

 Looks-wise, we like 'wolfy'-looking dogs most. We both absolutely love huskies and this would be our top choice, but I've done a ton of research and we're not sure if it'd be a good fit for our situation. I'm also a big fan of Shiba Inus but am worried about the aloofness! I also like the look of German Shepherds but the breed restriction issues put me off. We like labs and collie-type dogs as well, and we're not fans of small dogs like chihuahuas.

**5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Just basic commands - sit, stay, stop etc. If they like learning more commands or tricks then great, but not a requirement

# Care Commitments

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

During the week, a couple of hours a day. On the weekend, pretty much the whole day most of the time.

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

We'd be looking to get a dog walker (probably daily) for weekdays. I'd also be up for a short walk in the morning, and another longer one in the evening in the park, depending how much exercise is needed. We live opposite a (smallish) park (30 seconds away!), which has an unfenced dog area. On the weekends, we might do the odd hike or go to a bigger (fenced) dog park.

**8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

Some brushing would be ok - few times a week. Willing to do grooming at home but may also pay a professional, depending how tricky it is.

# Personal Preferences

**9)	What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium - probably up to about 60 pounds. We'd consider something a bit smaller (30 pounds maybe) but we're not really into small dogs.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Some shedding is ok as long as it's manageable with a robot vacuum and a weekly house clean! Some barking is ok but we do live in an apartment block so it couldn't be excessive (the block is dog friendly, and we only have neighbors on one side and above - next door neighbor has a dog - but I think we'd get complaints if it was barking constantly). Would prefer  a minimal amount of slobber.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It would be more convenient to be able to but it's not a deal breaker.

# Dog Personality and Behavior

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

We'd like a dog that is affectionate and likes being petted - ideally one that'd sit near us when we're on the sofa, for example - but it doesn't need to be a lap dog!

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Slight preference for eager to please but not totally sure.

**14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

As long as it's not aggressive towards visitors, we don't mind.

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

No

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Chewing, excessive barking, aggression towards other people

# Lifestyle

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

On weekdays, we both are out from about 8 to 6. However, there is some flexibility - some days one of us can probably work from home some or all of the day. We will get a dog walker for days we are going to be out the whole day.

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

My husband has similar preferences to me, but is less dog obsessed than I am - but he likes them and is up for getting a dog. He's willing to share responsibilities but I think it's likely I'll do a bigger share of the 'work'.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

No. Maybe in future we'd get another dog but not until we were in a bigger place, with a yard.

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

Not regularly at the moment but we have friends with kids, and it's likely we'll have kids in a few years (i.e. within the dogs lifetime!)

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

We rent and are allowed 1 dog, with no breed or size restrictions. We live in a fairly large 1 bed apartment. There is a small communal courtyard, but otherwise we do not have a yard. We will likely continue to rent for a few years, and then we'll either be buying or moving back to the UK where we're from (we own an apartment there).

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

we live in san francisco, california.   There seem to be some rules around pitbulls, and potentially insurance issues with some breeds.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

It's moderate most of the time - average low in winter is 43f and the warmest days get to 80/90f

# Additional Information and Questions

**24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.**

We're really keen to make sure we make the right choice and get a dog that we can provide a good home for for life. We are willing (and expect to) take a dog to training classes and socialise it early on.  We will travel back to the UK 1-2 times a year - we have friends who may dogsit, or will take them to a kennel if not.

"[Good Girl](https://imgur.com/JfOYGUF)

I know this is long, but she was my first dog friend and I'm not even a dog person. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First, I think it's fair that you know I'm a cat person. I never had a dog as a child, I was attacked twice by large dogs as a child, and in general it's hard for me to get past that ""dog smell"". BUT that's what made Gertie so special. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In late 2015, we found her wandering some rural back roads freezing and starving. Even though I'd never had a dog friend before, I love animals and I certainly couldn't leave her out there. So we scooped her up, put her in the warm car, and drove around knocking on doors and trying to find her home. It was getting late and dark so we decided to take her home for the night and call shelters in the morning. I had a 4 month old at the time who was exclusively breastfed, so many nights we would sleep on the couch or in the rocking chair. This tiny little chihuahua just hopped up and snuggled right in with me on the couch. I'll never forget it - how happy she seemed to be warm. her big, bug eyes looking up at me whenever I got up. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the morning I called the county shelter. They said that where I found her was the next counties jurisdiction. So I called them. They said it was my counties responsibility. So I made flyers and went back to the road to see if anyone was missing her. She was so tiny - only about 2lb at the time. I called some other rescues, but no one had room or didn't want her. So the kids and I took her to the store and we got her a nice coat, some booties, and some toys. She wouldn't eat dog food, but seemed to like the cat food (our cat wasn't too big on the idea, however). My aunt is a vet so she said cat food would be ok if she wouldn't eat soft puppy/dog food. (She never did. She wouldn't even eat the special Chi mix). 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 weeks go by and still no sign of her first home. We were already potty training her. The cat had finally warmed up to her (or given in...). Just wiggled her way into our hearts just like she did with the covers. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We were still calling her dog, so we though up some names. She made me think of that scene in 101 Dalmations about them watching the people walking their dogs on the sidewalk and how they looked like each other. I imagined she was owned by an ugly old woman with a nasty disposition and the name Gertrude just stuck. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Now, Chihuahuas aren't exactly energetic dogs. She didn't quite understand fetch and didn't like to play for too long. Once around the block was enough for her. But Chi's are loyal and protective. She guarded our house and sidewalk and yard and garden and trees and fence...like nobody's business. So in April this year we moved. The new house had a fenced in back yard, but some of the fence was spaced out. So we put chicken wire around the bottom. She kept getting out and damnit it all if random people didn't bring her back home. We live a few doors down from a grocery store and she would frequently wander over and bark at people as they came out. If we were out working in the yard or the garage, we would let her out and she would stick by us. If we weren't out there she thought she owned the block. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The problem, is that we live on a busy one way. And my husband let her out this morning while he was working in the garage and he forgot she was out there. The kids and I were inside cleaning and I didn't even notice she was gone (she usually hid from the broom, but was the vacuums superior). I saw a police car out the window roll by, stop, back up. He got out. *that's weird. what's he doing* You couldn't see her or the ground because there was a bush in the way, but he stepped to the side *no...* and there was a thin, dark blue thing in his hand *no no no no* my heart sank like the Titanic. I knew. I ran out the door and I saw her tiny little 5lb body lying there. I didn't know what to do. She died all alone (though probably instantly). It looked as though someone had placed her on the grass between the sidewalk and curb. Who could do that and not see if anyone was around that loved her? 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My heart is absolutely broken. My 12 year old son is devastated. They were best buds. Top it all off it was his birthday party today. He cried when he went to bed as she slept with him almost every night. I usually stay up late doing homework or housework or work work and she would sit with me until she was ready for bed. I liked how little and cat like she was. She fit so perfectly in my lap. I really never thought I would take this so hard, but it's very quiet in the house right now and her little bed she never slept in (but humped violently) is empty. Her toys just sit there. Her little pink jacket with the fur around the collar is hanging on its hook with her pink leash with the little bow. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She was a good girl. I really don't know what to do..... We buried her this morning in the family pet garden. I chose a nice spot under the zucchini plot. I think she'd approve. My grandma made her a little cross. My mother and brother came - she loved them so much and would go so excited whenever they came round. She was the perfect dog for this cat person and I'll never have another like her.

"After speaking with my SO and several other people who have gone through similar feelings, I’ve decided to post. Please read to the end before making judgements. 

My SO and I adopted a dog in late June. We had been discussing adding another animal to our family (we have a cat) and decided on which shelter to adopt from. We gathered all necessary supplies for the general breeds and sizes we were most interested in (toys, bowls, treats, etc.) and went looking at the shelter. We looked and interacted with almost every dog regardless of breed, size, and age. 

We both really connected with a dog that had only been at the shelter for a day. Texas has a law that all animals brought in as strays must be kept on a 3-day hold for observation and to give owners a chance to find their lost animals. The morning he was available we were there ready to adopt. We signed all the paperwork and were set to pick him up 2 days later (he needed neutering and his shots). 

I felt an extreme amount of guilt about adopting a dog that hadn’t been at the shelter for very long. I felt guilty that the dog we choose was a “desired breed” instead of a pit bull type dog. I felt wrong calling him a rescue dog when he hadn’t been at the shelter for longer than a week. 

The day we’re set to pick him up I get a call that his heart-worm test came back positive. We decided to adopt him anyway, despite what we thought would be a major financial set-back. We were lucky enough to find out the shelter partners with local vets to provide no-cost treatment to animals adopted from their facility. That was truly an unexpected blessing and something I’m incredibly grateful for. 

Once we got him home and took him to our vet of choice for a check up we found out he also had hookworms and a case of kennel cough. He also proved to be very hyper and energetic. 

Th first couple of weeks after we brought him home were hard. On top of the guilt I felt for not choosing an older, longer stay dog, I also felt like I didn’t adequately prepare myself for having a dog in my life. He was a lot of work and had a lot of energy I wasn’t fully prepared for. He didn’t have any training so he had accidents and didn’t know not to chew on things. I hate to admit it but there were days when I did feel regret about adopting him. 

After having him for a little over 2 months now, I can say all those feelings evaporated. He is the joy of my life. The work and effort we put into training him really paid off, and he flows well into our daily lives and routines. He is now hookworm free and starts treatment for his heart-worms next week. I don’t feel guilty about choosing him over other dogs at the shelter anymore. By simply adopting a dog, I opened another space at the shelter for a dog in need. At least two people have also adopted from that shelter because of how highly my SO and I speak about it. The reason I’m choosing to share this experience is because I was ashamed to admit I had these feelings. But, I think they’re completely normal because adding a living creature into your life who depends entirely on you is a major adjustment that takes time.

"Hello there!

&amp;#x200B;

We just received our first puppy and wanted advice on pet insurance. My work provides Nationwide My Pet Protection (30 per paycheck/60 a month) and My Pet Protection with Wellness (50 per paycheck/100 a month). It seems to cover accidents &amp; illnesses, hereditary &amp; congenital, cancer, dental diseases, behavioral treatments, Rx therapeutic diets &amp; supplements, special &amp; er with 250 annual deductible and 7500 max benefit. The wellness plan adds wellness exams and shots.

Confused if this is better than Nationwide's regular Major Medical or Major Medical with Wellness Plus. Both are cheaper at 31/mo and 50/mo but I'm not sure how they differ from the My Pet Protection plan. Also wondering if it's worth us getting another insurance such as Healthy Paws (on research seems a lot of people recommend that).

"Hi everyone! 

I have finally convinced an aquaintance of mine to let me take her dog off her hands. He is a 4 year old Chihuahua mix that has been to a vet once and is not neutered, so that is something that is going to get done as soon as I have him. He has spent the majority of his life contained to one room and has very seldom gone for a walk, so he has virtually no training whatsoever. 

I had dogs my entire childhood but the training and vet stuff was taken care of my parents - they were all fixed as soon as they safely could be and trained while they were puppies. I have two cats now and he will be my first dog in 5 years. I have no clue where to begin.

So I guess my questions are:

1. He sprays and howls, presumbly due to not being fixed. Are these behaviours that will stop once he's neutered, or is it harder to stop since he's older?

2. I don't even know where to start in terms of training. He is a smart dog but will it be harder since he's older? Would a training class (like the ones at PetSmart) be of any use here?

3. I adopted one of my cats at 10 years old, but she made herself right at home so there was no adjustment period needed for her. The dog is very anxious so I assume he will be nervous in a new home away from his owner and other animals. What can I do to make this transition as stress-free as possible for him?

Any other tips/advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much!",dogs,"[Help] Taking in an unaltered, untrained dog"

"We’ve had our 8month old dog about 2 months. Had our cat about 5 years. Cat is not dog-savvy (won’t fight back, always runs) and turns out the dog has a high prey drive. The cat is getting a bit bolder about being around the dog, but still spends most of her time hiding or running. The dog is constantly fixated on the cat.

When she starts to get fixated I try to distract her, get her focused on me, usually make her sit, or lie down, and sometimes do target practice and other small tricks like “paw” to get her attention, but sometimes it’s just impossible to even get her to look at me.

So I stayed. I smiled, and I stroked her fur, and I told her what a good girl she was until I felt her body stop moving and the vet confirmed that was it. I lost it.

"My dog is an Australian Shepherd and border collie mix and is about a year a half old. My SO and I have had him for about 6 months now. He’s been relatively healthy aside from some illness he wasn’t treated for at the shelter (which was quickly taken care of with medication) and a hot spot a couple of months ago.

He used to love drinking water and would do anything for an ice cube and would drink his bowl of water as soon as it was set down. Lately he doesn’t care for ice cubes and he barely drinks his water but still goes for the puddles outside.

Over the past day or two he’s also been laying in more enclosed spaces. He doesn’t normally sleep or lay in his kennel on his own but the past few days we’ve found him hanging out in there. This is a little weird to us since he doesn’t normally like going in there. He also tried jumping behind a chair just to sit in the corner of the living room. 

There’s a recliner that’s near the corner of the room and the couch directly next to it so the only way he can get back there is jumping down from the arm of the couch or squeezing between the two. He used to go back there just to lay down and put his head under the back of the recliner but we decided we wanted to stop that so he wouldn’t get hurt in any way. He’s good about not going there but today he forced himself past me just to sit back there and pant.

This is the next thing: he’s panting more often now. It’s summer in the south so I can understand him being hot outside or panting because he’s excited about guests, but the apartment is cold and he’ll pant just sitting around. It’s one of those things where I can’t imagine why he’s worked up so it worries me.

My SO recently moved into the other bedroom in their apartment and someone else has moved into the new room (who the dog loves). Over the past week our dog has been laying outside the old bedroom more and I don’t know if it’s because he think it’s still his space, if he trying to sniff out the new roommate and his cat, or if it’s something else. 

He’s still playful, eating, and desiring just as much as attention as usual, but something feels a little bit off. I don’t know if we need to take him to the vet but I’m feeling like we should. He’s a little sleepier today than usual but I can’t tell if that’s something wrong with him or he’s just having a lazy day.

Are these things I should I worry about? I don’t know if I’m being overly concerned or there’s something we should really be looking into. Googling isn’t helpful since the answers are either “it’s just stress” or “they’re dying and it’s time to be sad.” Should I take my dog to the vet soon? Any help is greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: Tonight we’ve noticed he’s been holding up a single paw sometimes when he sits. He’s switched paws a couple times too. He’s not limping, not pulling away or yelling in pain, and there’s nothing stuck.

"I have been preapproved to bring home a puppy that I’ve fallen in love with. My parents foster dogs and in the past month I’ve gotten a job that allows me enough financial security to own my own dog. I went to meet this dog at their house and fell in love with her. The only step left is tomorrow she is meeting my roommate’s dog to see if they get along. However, there was an incident today that is making me question if I should go through with the adoption.

She is a 4 month old lab, pit, and Rottweiler mix. She was part of a litter of 12 that for the first 2 months of their lives, they were left outside to fend for themselves.

Today we had a lot of people over for Labor Day. She is fine with people, though a little shy. I was taking this opportunity to do some leash training and I was giving her treats pretty frequently to reinforce things I saw as positive, such as looking at me when I said her name, sitting or lying down, or following me when I walked away (before, she would flatten like a pancake when I put the leash on her). There were 2 other dogs that she had been perfectly fine with for the past few days that were walking and standing nearby. I was doing this for maybe 10 minutes when suddenly she snapped and lunged at one of the dogs. However we didn’t realize this is what had happened until a few minutes later when she did it again, because in that second we had all looked away at something else. So twice within 1 minute she growled and lunged at a dog. 

I put the treats away after that and she went back to normal. She was playing with the other dog just fine after that. 

I asked her previous foster if she has ever seen food aggression in her. She said once, she was eating in her crate and another puppy walked by and she growled at him. She said she never saw her show any aggression outside of the crate. 

I have fallen in love with this puppy and I would hate to back out on this adoption. Common sense is telling me that I should not take on a dog with an issue like this. Outside of this food aggression towards the other dogs, she is perfectly fine towards people and seems very easy to train. 

I guess my question is, how easy is this to manage, really? Could this aggression spread to toys or other possessions, and become aimed towards people as well? Do the pros of owning a food aggressive dog outweigh the cons? 

Bear in mind she is expected to mature at around 80 lbs. If I adopt her, I will enroll her in training classes. IF her aggression gets worse, her size could make her quite the handful. Or am I reading too much into these 3 instances?

like I said, I really really like her otherwise.

"Background: My fiancee and I adopted our dog from a shelter more than 6 months ago. The dog is a border collie mix, estimated to be 4 years old. The previous owner of the dog died leaving our dog and another. The dog was aggressive since we brought him. Whenever he doesn't like a touch from a human or another dog, he would snap and nip on the hand. We had a behaviorist coming home to see his behavior. The behaviorist said (after hours with him) that it is alright. The behaviorist added that nipping is the way to warn you that he doesn't like what you are doing. We live in a spacious 60 square meters appartment with no other pet. We take him out at least 2hrs per day. We walk with the dog out 4 times per day spread across the day. The time outside is split between playing scavenger hunt in the dog park (when the dog park is empty) and walks on a 5m long leashes so he can explore comfortably and safely. We try to make the time indoor as stimulating as we can. Keeping indoor time stimulating is really hard specially that our dog does not like any toy, we manage though with kongs and some kibble in a box with cloth tht he digs in for hours.
We spent the last six months of our time trying to avoid whatever annoys the dog. We used muzzle when we had to do something he doesn't like (nail clipping, vet visits). All fine until two days ago. I was combing the dog's hair (like we always do) and I believe I touched something that caused him pain. The problem is, this time he didn't nip or showed teeth. This time he full on went to bite my finger. I had to hold him by the neck to leave the finger. This is not the first time the dog bites me, it is just the first time he is so intent to hurt. My index was almost chopped.
I am not angry about that accident. I know that my dog loves me and that he trusts me. I am just afraid now of the future. There is no set of things he hate, some times he will turn crazy for no apparent reason. The dog does not intend harm, but he might hurt my fiancee (who leaves with me) or another dog or even worse.
We are cautious with him all the time. We never let children or small dogs approach him. I am just afraid of one time that something unexpected happens and the worst occur.
I love my dog. I am willing to take more bites (if it doesn't cause permanent damage). I am just wondering when to decide that the dog is a hazard or not safe. I am not angry or emotional in anyway. I just want to avoid serious injury for someone. I can't muzzle the poor animal all the time. I can't re-home the dog either since other people might not realize how aggressive he can become.

**Introduction**

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, our first.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We would rather go through a breeder. We’ve checked local shelters, the dogs tend to be larger than we’re prepared for, and we’re not sure about the emotional issues they may carry.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

* 15lb to 20lb, low to medium energy, non-shedding.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* My SO is interested in Bichons because of their size. I am interested in labradoodles because I have met some who were smart, moderate in energy, and loving. EDIT: Forgot, she asked me to also include Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and Shih Tzu on the list.

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Apart from basics, we’d like to be able to let the dog run around without a leash and know that it’ll come back. I’d like to exercise like run or bike with it someday if the dog’s size allows it. We’re not picky.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* On weekdays, maybe 1.5 hours per day. More on weekends.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Can exercise and playing with the dog be done simultaneously?

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* A local breeder suggested the labradoodle might need weekly care or less often, this wouldn’t be a problem for us.

**Personal Preferences**

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

* 15lb to 20lb.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The least shedding possible. Barking, maybe not a lot, but some? Unsure about slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This is a nice to have, but if we need to stick with a 20 foot leash, we’ll deal.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* A bit of both.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* A local breeder suggested as first time owners that an eager-to-please dog will be easier for us to trian.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Any reaction is fine. It’d be nice if the dog could sit and wait for visitors before approaching. If it can’t, it is not a problem for us to control the dog’s environment so it cannot approach immediately.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No/unknown.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* For the first year, we can limit this to 4 hours, maybe 5. Ideally, 8 or 9.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My SO wants a dog that is more snuggly and smaller. I want one that is more playful and larger.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* No

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* We do not have kids. We may someday.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* We’re in Midwest USA, no relevant laws apply.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* January 33°F/22°F Aug 84°F/66°F

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* My SO and I both work full time. Her schedule is erratic and changes day to day, she might work regular business hours or might work later in the day. She occasionally works weekends. I have a more typical work schedule, with options to occasionally work from home. I can come home during lunch, although it would only be about an hour and half of that would be driving.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  

* We’re trying to figure out how to provide the time and attention to the dog. My schedule is more regular so for now we’re assuming I’d be setting more of the dog’s schedule. A schedule for me today might be waking up at 6:15am to eat breakfast and shower, leaving for work at 7:30am, leaving work around 5pm to head to the gym, and getting home around 6:30pm or 7pm. I’m trying to figure out what I can change to accommodate a dog. Wake up a little earlier and play fetch? Find some way to prep breakfast ahead of time so I can walk the dog and eat in the morning? Invest in a home gym so I can be home earlier in the evenings? I’m not sure how others have gotten by.

We’ve heard that mixed breeds may have a better chance of avoiding genetic health issues that pure breeds have, and we’ve also heard that smaller dogs may be at risk for certain heart disease, but we don’t know how true it is or if that should influence our breed selection or size selection, or not.

EDIT: I don't know depending on the breed or size if running with the dog or biking with the dog is possible once they are fully grown. Doing so is not a requirement, but would be nice.",dogs,[Breeds] SO and I are looking at getting our first dog. Looking to learn to make the right choice.

Today I tried a leash and harness on Mac and let the cats down on the first floor. Things were going fine for a while. Mac laid on the couch and the cats did their thing. Some curious nose boops were had and even a nuzzle from one of the cats. 

After a few hours Munch (one of the cats) got a little too curious about Mac which peaked his curiosity. She backed off and when he crawled over to her she ran, which trigged him to run. Thus was the end of our little experiment today. Munch went to hiss and growl mode after that.

"I've had my 11 year old Labrador her whole life (and I've had my husband for 10 :). She loves us both very much but she is definitely more my dog. Since I've become pregnant (currently 38 weeks!) she has taken to sleeping on my husbands side of the bed. She sleeps on the floor as close to him as possible. She has a bed very close to this but usually prefers the floor next to him, almost under his side of the bed. 

I'm wondering if anyone else's dog has had a change in behavior similar to this when becoming pregnant. To be clear, it doesn't bother me- I just find it curious. She is just as affectionate to me during the day and always wants to be close to both of us when possible.",dogs,[DISCUSSION] Labrador prefers to sleep next to my husband now that I am pregnant. Anyone else have a similar experience?
"\*\*Introduction\*\*  

1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* No, I have a sheltie and have trained her out of her reactivity. We've gotten our CGC and are about to get our CGCA. She doesn't have the size or drive necessary to be a suitable service dog, though. She's also lacking in the necessary confidence.

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

\* 100% breeder, I want predictable genetics and temperament. How do you know how to find a service dog breeder? Do you just find a reputable breeder of whatever breed and the dogs should be suitable for service work? Most ""service dog"" breeders online I've seen look sketchy.

3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* Non-aggressive, biddable, low/medium prey drive, high handler focus, friendly to strangers/other animals. Medium/large size (60-70 pounds?), I'm not interested in dogs that are aloof in any way, those that lack confidence, or those that may have any reactivity problems. I want a drivey dog but not one that is neurotic. I'm also not really into curly/wire hair, but I could probably deal with it if necessary.

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* Goldens and labs for their reliability in service work. Also interested in flat coated retrievers since I had one as a kid. I also like English/Irish Setters or maybe spaniels?

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\* Medical alert, tactile stimulation (DPT), body blocking, search the house for intruders, in addition to the obvious training necessary for service work (CGC, CGCA, public access training).

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* 24/7 as I am looking for a service dog

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* Maybe an hour of dedicated exercise in addition to what they would get going around with me all day. Absolutely no dog parks, I don't trust other owners.

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* Yeah, I don't really mind any grooming. I have a sheltie, I do all the grooming on her. The only thing I'd be uncomfortable with is trimming hair like you would on poodles.

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Medium to large, large enough that DPT would be effective, but not so large that they would be difficult to fit in places. Plus, extra large breeds don't live long enough that the training would be worth it, sadly.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* Don't care about shedding. Barking and slobber should be kept to a minimum.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* Important, but can be worked on with training

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* I want a dog that will be by my side all the time.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  

\* Eager to please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    

\* Friendly, preferably minimal barking, but that can be trained out. I want zero reactivity. No aggression or shyness whatsoever.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  

\* Not at all.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* Shyness, reactivity, unfriendlyness with strangers/other animals/children. 

\*\*Lifestyle\*\* 

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  

\* Not really ever 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* It would be my service dog so that doesn't really matter, BF doesn't care

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* Yes, dog (sheltie) and cat. Both are lazy af

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\*  Probably? Definitely has to be friendly towards them. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\* Yes, no ""dangerous"" breeds due to renters insurance, please.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* USA, no banned breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Summer high is 115, average around 90-95. Winter is around 50?

Hi guys,


I've been with my Bichon Frise puppy for 2.5 weeks now and I'm at my wits end. Right now I'm living alone because my parents and brother have been on holiday for a while and looking after this little guy has proven more difficult than I could have ever expected. I don't know what to do anymore so I'm venting here :/


Before I picked him up, I did so much research. Trust me, I spent day and night for months reading about raising puppies and Bichon breeds. Finally, I picked him up and since then my life has been consumed by constant overwhelming depression.


To be honest he's not a terrible puppy. I know the problem is with me but I can't help myself right now.


I can't get more than 2 hours of sleep at a time which simply doesn't work because by the time I fall asleep, he's awake for a potty break again.


I really struggle to tire him out especially since he hasn't had his second vaccinations so I can't walk him in the park. I try to keep him on a schedule:


9:00 Breakfast and potty


9:30 - 11:00 Play tug, chase &amp; obedience training


11:00 - 13:00 Potty then nap


13:00 - 15:00 Potty then play with toys &amp; obedience training


15:00 - 17:00 Nap


17:30 Dinner and potty, no water from here onwards.


17:30 - 19:30 Nap


Until 22:00 I try to play with him to tire him out with potty breaks every hour and put him to bed at 22:00. Sometimes he literally just flops onto the floor and takes an hour nap before bed time (ruining my plan).
From then onwards he wakes up every 2-3 hours and I take him out then take him straight back to bed. This is where he starts whining and Im just begging for some sleep.


He relentlessly whines if I take one step out of my room. I can't wash my hands, eat, shower etc without him just freaking out. I've tried training him by going out of the room several times throughout the day when he's in his crate but he doesn't show any sign of improvement. I put several chew toys for him to stay busy in his crate but he just ignores them in there.


Im trying to get him used to his collar and leash but once again its proving difficult. He's fine with his collar but as soon as I put the leash on him he freaked out screaming. I didn't even pull him but he started pulling back and screaming. I tried luring him with treats but it didn't work he just put his whole body on the floor and refused to move.


He's shown great improvement in simple commands like, take it/leave it, come here, sit so this has made me feel less incompetent as an owner.


Guys I'm really struggling and I dont know where to turn anymore. I feel so incompetent and can't help but think this was the worst mistake I've ever made in my life. I have no time for myself, I cant sleep, I cant eat, I cant shower, I cant do anything. Do I give him away? Surely someone else out there can give him a better life than me. I feel like I'm losing my sanity! Please someone help me decide.",dogs,[Help] I dont know what to do anymore

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* We currently have a 10 y/o rescue , who we got about 8 years ago. We dont know her specific mix,but we assume some kind of herding dog or spitz, as she looks kind of like a border Collie, but white. Before her I had a Saluki. 

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* In our country there really arent that many rescues, and breed specific ones are pretty hard to come by, so we are looking to get a puppy from a reputable breeder. 

1. Describe your ideal dog.

* Pretty low key in the house, preferably low - but up to medium exercise.  My first dog, a Saluki, was awesome,but super aloof and not very cuddly. Would prefer a friendly dog who likes a few cuddles every once in a while. Preferably also a dog who is not too stubborn. 

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

*  We've been looking into a few, but information varies and we're still very uncertain. We have been strongly considering a standard schnauzer, but after reading a few books on them I'm worried about their energy levels. The no shedding is a great plus, but not essential. Basset looked like a pretty good fit for a while, but the health problems seem way too overwhelming, and combined with the stubborness we're not so sure anymore. We have rarely had to deal with any sort of health problem (except old age) with the two dogs we've had, and i dont really want a dog prone to a lot of health risks. The Basset fauve de bretagne and griffon seem healthier, and look awesome - but I dont think their personalities and exercise needs would be as good a fit. Our main choice right now is the English Cocker Spaniel, but i see those too have some health issues. The more we seem to read about a specific breed the more sceptical we seem to get, so right now we just have no idea. We've taken a few breed selectors online, and a lot of them seem to be suggesting Old English Sheepdogs, but the amount of grooming seems pretty overwhelming to be honest. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Just basic obedience

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 1-2 hours plus walks.

1. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

*  Our current dog and us go on walks totaling to about an hour each day. We also have a large fenced in yard (about 2 acres). 

1. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* We will pay a professional if necessary.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium

1. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Can handle some, as long as it is not excessive

1. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would be nice, but its not super important. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* We would like a fairly affectionate dog,but not one who constantly needs to be on your lap or have your attention.

1. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Preferably one who is eager to please

1. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* We can tolerate some barking, but would prefer a friendly, easy-going dog.

1. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No. We already have a senior dog, so the ability to get a long with other dogs is very important. 

1. Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

1. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* My husband and i would share the responsibility. 

1. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

1. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

1. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We own a house.

1. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Norway. The breeds who are banned here are not dogs we are considering. 

1. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer 20-30 degrees (celsius) Winters - ranges from -15 to -5 degrees ( celsius ) on average, with some milder weather in between. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

*  Would prefer a medium sized breed, but we're open to other sizes as well, as long as they are not giants or super small. Our main issue with many of the smaller sizes is their look (neither of us like the look of the Havanese, cavalier, french bulldog etc) , which we realize shouldn't be super-important, but if there are some options out there for a breed with both the right look AND temper we would love to hear about them and we're hoping for some suggestions. Our top priority though is finding a chill, low key and affectionate dog with low to moderate exercise needs, and which will go well with our older dog (and not go berserk around our chickens).

"So I have a male 2 yo dachshund (neutered) who I adopted a little over a year ago. When I first brought him home he would sometime have accidents in the house but I believe that was due to him being kept in a shelter where they were not able to potty train him. Since then, he has learned (somewhat) that he is expected potty outside. That being said, he never has any accidents in the house unless I have guests or other dogs over. He gets jealous and pees in spite almost every time someone is over. He will even do this when I go to my boyfriends for the weekend when he feels he isn’t getting enough attention.

"She’s been with us for a week. Our routine is I take her out for a morning walk before heading to work, and my mom is with her for the rest of the day until I get back.

My concerns:

When the dog arrived at our house, her poop came out as a single solid piece, with what seemed like a healthy consistency. Her poop has gradually become small, dry, and harder to pass. 

Especially worrying is that she refuses her regular pellets now, and barely even drinks water anymore (I suspect because she knows milk is on offer).

"Okay, so in March of year 2017, I made a really immature decision. Against the advice of my parents and a one or two classmates that I knew at the time, I got a puppy. I got him just because I wanted a dog. I underestimated the responsibilities assocsciated and all the troubles that I might face owning a dog for the first time. Things like whom to leave the dog with during vacations has been a great trouble.
The area we live in doesn't have many trainers to begin with and all those who I could find were just very cruel. Their solution to every problem was just using a stick or something to beat the dog.
So I stayed away from them and decided that I have no other option than to train the dog myself.
By the way, I was dumb enough to get a Dogo Argentino as my first dog. As the pup grew, I feel like the pup I got is a mix. 
As a male, he lacks a little height and isn't very muscular, he has brown and black spots and his face is broad but not as much as it should be.
So I used information from internet to train my Dogo mix.
I taught him some basic commands and he was alright in the beginning. But as I said, my parents were against the dog so they never took any effort to train him or look after him, it was all on me. As every puppy has a tendency to bite things in the house even after getting chew toys, he did destroy a lot of furniture and peed in the house. 
So instead of helping me train him against that, my parents left the dog in balcony every time that we had to leave him alone at the house, though I was against it, there was nothing I could do to convince them at the time. Walking this dog has always been a pain. So much pulling. I walked him most of the time but when I had classes or had to go somewhere that I couldn't avoid, my dad walked him and any amount of training that I gave the dog went to waste because he would let him pull and do whatever he wanted.
The street dogs and other pet dogs are a big problem during the walk. They bark at him and try to attack him for no reason and then my dog pulls on the leash more. If he sees the dogs that he's friends with, instead of walking with me to the dog calmly so I can let him play, he'll start pulling and jumping in the middle of the road.

During the time I've had this dog, I've gone out to see my friends very less because no one would care for this dog when I'm gone initially. My friends don't come over much because my dog jumps a lot. He never bites or acts aggressive towards any guest but he just jumps too much with excitement. These reasons have caused me to be very lonely.

With time I've convinced my parents to let him stay inside the house under the watch of our maid when nobody is at home and the dog just sleeps and acts fine most of the time. I've also taught the dog not to pee in the house.But those are the only things that I've had success with.

My dog never eats without the eat command but he has gotten food aggressive over time and I don't know what to do about it. Whenever anybody even tries to walk around his food bowls when his food is being prepared, he starts to growl and show his teeth. Sometimes he even jumps but never bites. This has made my family scared of him. It was so hard for me to get my parents to bond with the dog and now it's all ruined. The dog's behaviour was limited to food previously but now the growling and jumping occurs even randomly for no reason or if someone tries to play with the dog while he is sleeping.

This aggression, his hyperactivity in the house when we are around (he's calm when alone), so much pulling during walks, it's all made it impossible to handle him.

I walk him twice a day daily, sometimes I can't walk him in the morning but it's rare, usually it's 2 times a day. And that walking is just getting harder and harder. The dog is completely fine after a few hours of walk and then is completely energetic again and causing trouble in house. 
Paired with tje aggression it's impossible to handle him.

I'm at the end of my patience now and I don't know what to do, how do I fix his behaviour?
If it wasn't for me, the dog would on the streets by now because my parents are tired of him, my little brother who supported me is also with them now. It's just me stopping them.
We all love the dog but the behaviour is too much.
I've sacrificed my life outside school for my dog and it's just too much now.
I'll be going to college next year and I won't be here most of the time so thw dog's responsibility will be up to my family.

"Hi, 
My dog (corgi age 11)  two weeks ago was very weak. He was taken into emergency room given blood transfusion and spent the night there. He’s currently on atropica and prednisone for non regenerative anemia. His red blood count was 15% it is now 28%. They have done ultrasounds and numerous tests on him to rule out cancer, ticks etc.  

Last two days he started having a very minor nose bleed a few drops. 

He sneezed this out. It was one piece but I accidentally broke it in half when getting it from the floor.  Does it look like worm? It is brittle and maybe 3/4 of an inch long.

I did take him to emergency room and was left with what looked like an intern who said they had never heard of a worm or anything that could be sneezed out like that and they asked their colleague who said they had not either. They did a quick red blood count test just to be sure his count was still ok but other that said nothing could be done. 

Just wanted an opinion to see if it could be something they weren’t aware of? It looks pretty worm like to me but obviously I’m a layman but they haven’t been able to figure out a reason for his anemia so I was hopeful it was this. I fully realize I might be just desperately hoping for a solution to his anemia.

"My Mom is looking to get a dog. She's a near perfect fit for an owner (works at home, constantly going on walks already, extremely careful, able to give it a ton of attention, etc), with the one big issue being that she's always been allergic to dogs. 

Obviously, she is looking into hypoallergenic dog breeds that might help. But here's the issue, at least as relayed by her (I can't confirm if this is medically plausible, though she is a doctor so generally I take her at her word). Her allergies to dogs varies, depending certainly on the breed, but sometimes she even thinks depending on the dog itself (two separate questions I suppose). Certainly it helps in general to be hypoallergenic (she reacts much less), but it varies a lot depending on the dog, and an individual hypoallergenic dog might cause her just as much trouble as some other non-hypoallergenic dog, it just depends on the individual (obviously, I don't imagine this has thoroughly been tested, this is just her experience when visiting friends and family).

So my question is if there is some sort of method to test for allergies from a dog in advance. Is that a thing? I'd really hate for my Mom to get a hypoallergenic dog, and then find out she's reacting anyways, and have to find another home for it. That's just a poor outcome for everyone involved. Are there any common practices for determining if you'll be allergic to a dog in advance? 

I'm asking broadly for any sort of methods that are used. I mentioned breed vs individual dog above because I think these might be separate issues. I imagine testing for allergy to a certain breed is much more doable, and once that's confirmed she could just look to get that sort of dog. But she really does think that her allergies don't correlated perfectly to breed, and that sometimes she can be allergic to one dog and not another of the same breed,  in which case I was additionally curious if there was ever a way to test for allergies to a specific dog.

"Thank you so much for your help! All I really want from the world is a dog, ha. 

    **Introduction**

    1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

    * Yes, but I do have a fair bit of experience with animals. I have cared for a large variety of dogs ranging from pups as small as a Maltese to as large as an English Mastiff 

    2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

    * We prefer to rescue 

    3)	Describe your ideal dog.

    * An intelligent dog who can still be happy in our current situation (apartment living + both residents have a full time jobs). I love all dogs and would prefer a medium to large dog. This dog would be alright spending time indoors during the day and then could go hike or play in the evenings. My ideal dog right now is a more chill but still enjoys to play. I'm hoping for a cuddler as well! I want a dog who is willing to play with other dogs as I plan to have multiple once I live in a house with a yard. Also my ideal dog would be alright living with a variety of other pets. Right now we have a cat. 

    4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

    * Siberian huskies, German Shepherd's, Australian shepherds, and the like are my favorites but they all seem like the type of breed that would get depressed living in an apartment without a yard. 

    5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

    * house train, manners, come, stay, little tricks, fetch, etc

    **Care Commitments**

      6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

    * 1-3 hours

    7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

    * typically hiking, a lot of ball throwing in the park, and occasionally a trip to the dog park. 

    8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

    * yes to all of the above! Shorter hair is preferred because I do have some siblings with allergies that visit occasionally. 

    **Personal Preferences**

    9)	What size dog are you looking for?

    * medium to large

    10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

    * admittedly not too much. My apartment is 1200 sq ft and I think it'd get overwhelming fast. Happy to brush multiple times a week to cut down on shreding. 

    11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

    * Quite! I'd like to be able to go off leash on hikes or mountain bike rides. 

    **Dog Personality and Behavior**

    12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

    * Snuggly (:

    13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

    * in my mind I want eager-to-please, but I think do is own thing could be happier in my house. 
    
    14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

    * I would like my dog to be curious but not overbearing. He should not jump up on guests. 

    15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

    * No

    16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

    * excessive slobbering, inability to get along with other animals, bolting away /not staying

    **Lifestyle**

    17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

    * I teach middle school and am gone 6-5 M-F. My husband works three 12's and goes to school in the afternoons two days a week. I plan to take the dog to day care for the first month or two until their adjusted to the house and the cat. After that in a perfect world we would leave the dog at home. If not possible we may continue day care. 

    18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

    * they are happy to help! Most responsibilities will be shared. He probably would prefer a more medium sized dog. 

    19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

    * We currently have a very large Savannah cat who is very cuddly and friendly. I do plan to get a husky, naid, or German Shepherd in the coming 5 years. We also have an aquarium. 

    20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

    * Regularly enough, I have a lot of niblings. We also plan to have a kid somewhere in the next 3-5 years. 

    21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

    * We rent presently but there are no restrictions. We will be buying in 2 years or when the market crashes, ha. 

    22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

    * Utah, USA and there are no restrictions I can think of. 

    23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

    * summer can get to 106° F and winter drops to the low 20s.

Thank you!! 

Edit : thank you for sharing your insight!! It is worth noting that 3 months of the year I do not work so the dog will be receiving 8-9 hours playtime every day. That's only a fourth of the year though so I didn't want to base the breed off of that. ",dogs,"[Breeds] wanted a dog since birth, dog sat my whole life, finally in a position that I can have one!!!"
"I adopted my rescue dog about a year ago and she has become more and more comfortable at home over the past few months. Recently when she gets into a playful (much more often than in the past), she starts “snapping” at me. She has never actually made contact with my skin but I’m worried if that’s normal behavior. She looks happy and relaxed and not at all aggressive but I’m concerned why she’s suddenly exhibiting this behavior. Any ideas?

I just want to thank everyone for all the advice and information! I thought a lot about how to approach the issue to make everyone happy and decided to see how night crating goes. I left her crate in the living room and she let out a little yelp every 5 or 10 minutes until falling asleep within 30 minutes or so. It was relatively painless. She didn't cry until 6 am when she was up for the day. I'm cautiously optimistic that this will be a good option until she can be trusted more because there are some things that I just can't block her access to in my bedroom at night. I also got her some rib bones, beef hooves and a couple more toys. She will be the perfect dog in no time flat with all the help I'm getting here! 


Hi everyone! 

I brought home a 1 year old golden retriever mix a couple of weeks ago. She has done pretty well... came out of her shell and loves to play, but she is chewing up EVERYTHING. 

Thus far, we have lost a pair of shoes, bluetooth headphones, a phone charger, a vase full of silk flowers, a bag of candy and the wood shutters on my French doors. Last night I caught her trying to chew the corner of my sectional couch. She has plenty of toys and bully sticks that she loves... but the minute I leave her sight, she is headed to cause destruction. 

Most of the items she chewed were retrieved from on top of a table. And if I catch her with something inappropriate in her mouth, she bolts out of sight and acts like it's a game. How do I fix this?

EDIT:
I guess I should clarify that she is crate trained (but doesn't sleep in it) and confined to the living and kitchen area. She is confined to my bedroom at night and everything is picked up, but she crawls under things to find cords or grabs things from higher places to chew. ",dogs,[Help] My new rescue dog is chewing up everything!

"**Introduction**

​

1. *Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?*

Yes, it will be my first.

2)	*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a* [*reputable breeder*](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)*?*

No.

3)	*Describe your ideal dog.*

Medium-sized, with a compact / sturdy body. The coat is smooth, definitely not curly or wiry. Friendly, polite, cuddly; the type of dog that would happily follow you anywhere.

4)	*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?*

Primarily Corgis (either breed). They check almost every box on my list in terms of appearance &amp; size, and they are intelligent, trainable, and goofy.

Other breeds I like: Teckel, Beagle, Fox Terrier, Keeshond, Swedish Vallhund. I used to want to own Pugs &amp; Frenchies, but after doing my research, their health problems (and the moral dilemma that comes with them) wouldn’t let me. Chihuahuas seem interesting, too, but my SO doesn’t agree.

5)	*What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?*

Basics &amp; more-useful-than-fun stuff first, but I’d like to teach him more complex tricks if he is eager / craves mental stimulation.

​

**Care Commitments**

6)   *How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?*

2-3 hours dedicated exclusively to him; more in puppyhood, on the weekends, and my schedule permits on that specific workday.

7)   *How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?*

At least one hour daily (on a weekday) of walking, playing with other dogs, fetch, and soccer. More on the weekends, and if the weather &amp; my schedule allow it.

8)   *How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*

I don’t mind brushing him daily, cleaning his ears, trimming his nails, cleaning his teeth etc. I’d let a professional groomer take care of the haircuts, though.

​

**Personal Preferences**

9)	*What size dog are you looking for?*

Medium.

10)   *How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*

I’m ok with shedding if it’s manageable through daily brushing, diet, and vacuuming a lot. Barking can be a problem (because neighbors), but I’ll do my best to train him not to overdo it since puppyhood. I don’t mind slobber.

11)   *How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*

Not very.

​

​

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12)  *Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*

Snuggly.

13)  *Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?*

Both are ok.

14)  *How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?*

Any reaction is good as long as it is not hostile. Barking &amp; being suspicious are ok, but I don’t want an aggressive dog.

15)  *Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*

No.

16)  *Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?*

N/A.

​

**Lifestyle**

17)  *How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*

It varies a lot, but at worst, he’ll be alone for 7 hours; at best, someone (my SO usually) is home with him all day.

18)  *What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*

My SO agrees me with me on the size &amp; temperament, but he wants a lower-maintenance dog (a couch-potato). He is slightly less tolerant of shedding &amp; barking than I am. I will be the primary caretaker, but my SO will walk, feed, &amp; play with the dog whenever I can’t.

19)  *Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?*

I plan on bringing a second puppy to the family, after the first is between 1-2 years old.

20)  *Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*

No.

21)  *Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?*

The apartment we live has no breed restrictions AFAIK, as long as its size is reasonable (so no Great Danes probably).

22)  *What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*

We live in Romania. I'm aware of banned / regulated breeds (Pitbulls, Brazilian Mastiffs etc.), but I have no interest in owning those.

23)  *What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*

July: 22 °C / 72 °F &amp; January: -2 °C / 28 °F.

​

**Additional Information and Questions**

24)  *Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.*

I’m not planning on getting a dog very soon. I want to wait for 2-4 years until my life is a bit more stable (I'm 20 now) + I have a few free consecutive months to raise the puppy. Right now I’m just doing my research on breeds, breeders, and puppy training so I will be ready when that time comes.

"Hey dudes

As expected, my six month old houndish mix is very unreliable when it comes to recalling with heavy distractions around, whether it be people, dogs, other animals etc.

I know he knows what to do, as he has no issues with his commands in a normal environment, what can I do to boost his recalls effectiveness? 

I’m not really looking to off-leash him much, but my neighbors have a pair of boxers he absolutely loves to play with, and no (only invisible) fence. When he was younger he was super good about playing only in their yard, but recently when he gets up and excited he has been leaving their yard, and with a street there and possibly people walking past it could be very problematic. 

I’m cutting off his playtimes until I can work this out. 

I do work at doggie day care, and when he is with me I always try and work on recalls and placing. His recall in daycare has gotten much better, but still leaves much to be desired. 

I know he’s being stubborn, i just haven’t worked out what to do about it yet.

"Hi, 

I'm thinking about getting an English Springer Spaniel. I was originally looking more at Brittanys, but my understanding is that the English Springer Spaniels are a little bit less intense. I prefer the field-bred lines along several categories, like the fact that they have lighter coat, are less prone to ear infections, and have shorter ears. 

Since even dogs that hunt are companion dogs the \~9mo out of the year or so (i.e. when it's not hunting season), what are the key challenges to owning field-bred dogs as companion dogs only?

"So today I realized that with my training, and probably in other aspects of life, I expect myself to advance too much too fast, and that may be holding me back. In general when I train with my dog, Calvin, I expect him to learn 1 thing at a time, so training sessions are for just 1 learning task. Today I realized that with herding training I haven't been doing that. I've been working on something, and then expecting him and I to be able to continue to apply it once we get it down in that situation. He's great at holding to the fence in whatever direction he's moving, he's also great at doing a standing stop, and we are working on getting a lie down and turning. I've been expecting to go in with him and him to be able to do the first 2 things just like that, and work on the other 2 things at the same time as him doing those first 2. I didn't realize until today, when my training said ""hey lets just work on either turning, gate manners, or lie downs, we're putting too much on him"", that I was pushing him too hard. And I realized I do this in life as well. When I have to write a program or learn a skill and I've got the basics down, I then expect myself to be able to do everything without struggle and end up frustrating myself because, surprise surprise, I'm not going to be able to do it without more research or concentrating on each aspect, and if I don't realize that I'll never get better at those things. I think I will start to reevaluate how I go about working on things. I had always thought I was breaking them down into their smallest pieces, but I guess today I realized that those pieces all have their individual steps in them that I need to conquer first.

A bit about my current situation - I have a year-old male sterilized dog (cocker spaniel mix). He's the friendliest dog ever (he can play with any dog and not a barker at all) with high energy. I live in an apartment and work full time, but we spend a lot of time outdoor and he's mostly sleeping while i'm out. Never destroyed any furniture. He attended basic obedience and did OK. Honestly he's not the best mannered dog like you'd see in obedience competitions but he's alright. He doesn't have any separation anxiety.

"Hi, I'm really hoping you guys can help me diagnose/fix the problem my dog has been having. My chihuahua will not stop whining/crying throughout the day. He is around 10-11 years old, not neutered, and well trained. I believe I have ruled out worms and fleas since he is not biting his tail or rear end, isn't scooting across the floor, isn't scratching himself, and I've checked his feces several times and don't see any worms or anything out of the ordinary. This problem started about 3-4 months ago and hasn't changed much since (if anything it has gotten slightly worse over time). I don't believe he is injured or in any pain since he doesn't show any signs of pain and the only thing he does when you pick him up is wag his tail and lick your face. He stays inside except for the few times a day when he is let outside for 5-10 minutes to urinate/defecate and to get some sunshine. His urinating/defecating habits haven't changed at all. I've tried researching this problem online and I've basically ruled out any of the problems the different articles list. I also don't believe this is any kind of mental problem since nothing seems to have changed. He is also trained fairly well. He sits and stays on command, and I've also recently trained him to stay when I put a small treat on his nose and he won't attempt to eat it until I tell him to. Does anyone have any ideas what the problem could be? He is driving me absolutely crazy...

"There's a park not far from where I live, and there are a few street dogs who live there. I go there with my dog mostly because she really likes them and they play well together. 

There's one in particular that she clicks with - they're a similar size, same breed, and I guess he's not so old. However, he is very skinny, has some ticks, a small wound on one of the back thigh - in general, he's a normal street dog. 

There's hundreds of street dogs just in my neighbourhood and I can't help them all, but I'm in contact with this one several times a week so I kinda feel a bit of a need to do something. I've started taking some kibble with me (he gets so excited at the sound of the bag rustling!) I was also thinking about deworming with Drontal Plus, and giving Advantix for the ticks. Is this a good choice?

The wound isn't huge or especially worrying from my perspective, but it is sleeping a bit of white liquid. Does anyone have any suggestions for care? Clorhexidine? 

Some other users of the park often see to the vaccination and spaying of the female dogs, so I'm planning on inquiring into whether anyone knows if he's been vaccinated. But is there anything else I'm missing? 

I am toying with taking him to the vet, but I'd like to try to manage the situation without that. Otherwise I'd need to trap him, transport him, board him at the vets, etc, which seems like quite a palava for both me and the dog.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I can be flexible with exercise needs, but 2 hours on average would be about the maximum I could go. Walks/runs and dog park trips would be included

"We live in an area of the country that just gets roaches this time of year, and we have an old house, so they get in. So far I tried putting a little bit of diemetacious earth around, which didn't seem to do much, and a bunch of thsoe black plastic traps, but somehow my little dog got ahold of one of them that I'd shoved under the fridge and chewed it up (she's fine! called poison control, she was fine.) But now I'm scared to do anything! 

I crate them at night so I could conceivably set something out in the kitchen  overnight, since that's when they're active.

"I was walking my two dogs today when I walked past a guy walking his small dog. we stopped to let them smell each other, as my dogs are super friendly and love meeting other pups. they were sniffing each other for a good minute, tail wags all around, when all of a sudden my dog Z decided to bite the other dog on the back of the neck. we immediately pulled them apart and I asked to make sure the other dog was okay, and he assured me that he was and hadn't broken the skin. 

but I was horrified (and embarassed.) Z has never acted aggressively to other dogs before, usually he gives a sniff and then ignores them completely. however he is very excited when it comes to squirrels and rabbits and usually wants to chase them, so I think maybe that's what happened and he acted as if the smaller dog was prey? except he was just happily sniffing him for a solid minute and not chasing him or anything else.

I've had him for a year now, he's pretty well trained on leash and with basic commands. he's so friendly and relaxed, any time I have small kids over he loves to lick their faces and run around with him. I'm just at a loss as to why he suddenly did this. was there body language I missed? he just seemed excited like we he meets any other dog.

for reference, Z is 7 years old, 70lbs, a major mutt but maybe with some great Pyrenees or amstaff In him, not sure. the smaller dog was maybe 20 pounds. do I just have to avoid dogs in the future? is there any way I can teach him not to do this?",dogs,[help] my dog bit another dog today out of nowhere. how can I prevent this in the future?

I know that some dog breeds are alright to trim, and for others it's an absolute no-no and can lead to heat stroke and sunburns. I have a feeling some parts can be trimmed, but other parts shouldn't. I've been tracking her fur growth to see what parts keep growing and what parts stay at their current length.

&amp;#x200B;

**Shedding:** Very mild. Running your fingers through her fur, you'll only get 1 or 2 hairs. When brushing, there's a small amount of fur on the brush, but only about the size of a quarter.

​

**Flanks/Sides of the body:** Short, soft, and dense. Literally feels like dryer lint.

​

**Front legs:** Paws are short but have little tuffs of fur sticking out from between the toes. The tan part feels more wirey, but the black part has that same soft, dryer-lint-esc feeling to it.

​

**Shoulders:** Kind of merge into the neck/chest fur. Not as soft as the other fur, but also doesn't continuously grow. Slightly curly/wavy.

​

**Back legs:** Similar to the front legs, but where the black fur is, it is much longer. It is still that fluffy, dryer-lint texture. Matts very easily. Seems to keep growing.

​

**Hips:** Soft, short fur like on the flank, but with some more hair-like fur on the edges (see picture 4). Seems to keep growing.

​

**Chest:** Fluffy, long, slightly curly. Kind of a cross between the hair-like fur and the dryer-lint-esc fur. Doesn't seem to grow continuously.

​

**Belly:** Very long (like 3 inches), thin hair (see picture 4). Seems to keep growing. Definitely more hair-like than the ""dryer lint"" fur.

​

**Back:** Curly ""faux hawk"" trailing from her neck to her tail. More of a loose curl. Not very dense. Doesn't seem to grow continuously.

​

**Tail:** Long, thin hair like on the stomach. Seems to just keep growing with no sign of stopping. Strangely enough, doesn't get matted very easily despite being a good 4.5"" long.

​

**Neck/Shoulder blades area:** Similar texture to the fur along her back. Loose curls with a hair-like texture.

​

**Ears:** Similar texture to fur on parts of the chest. Kind of like a mix between the hair-like fur and the dryer-lint fur. Soft, but not wirey. Seems to keep growing. Matts VERY easily. I have a miniature schnauzer and she has similar fur on her ears. Grows continuously.

"This may end up being more of a rant than an actual discussion. 

At this point I’m used to hearing people say they want a husky, shiba inu, or corgi even if they’re not a great idea for the person. 

Yesterday, I talked with acquaintance who took it one step further. This person, who has very limited dog experience, wants a Caucasian Shepherd. I was immediately confused. How come a person who doesn’t have any livestock, or any land, want a huge territorial dog? Because they look “cool”. I began trying to educate the person, talking about how much training would be needed and how the dog would not like the lifestyle this person would provide (small yard and not enough exercise). Everything I said, this guy said “I don’t care the dog is cool”. I eventually brought up the fact the dog would more than likely bite someone and he thought that was “cool”. I then brought up the fact the dog could, and most likely would, be put down if it happens more than once or if it happens to be a child. 

So what is with this kind of person? I find it absolutely mind boggling that someone could have this thought process. ",dogs,Why do some people get dogs they know are wrong for their lifestyle? [discussion]
It’s so surreal when this happens with my dog and I love it. She’s like a little person. She just like lives here and does her own thing most of the day until she comes to me for cuddles or a walk.

" Lolly, 5 year old Vizsla on Saturday morning 28/07/2018 started throwing up and having diarrhea, we took her to the vet, who ran tests as follows: x-ray with full anesthesia which showed enlarged spleen (possibly due to anesthesia according to the vet), air in the intestines; blood-work showing low platelets (possibly due to enlarged spleen according to the vet), and that it is not poison; cause of diarrhea / throwing up not established. According to the vet the condition was not critical, even though it was not clear what was wrong, it was advised by the vet to go home for the weekend and come back on Monday to repeat the tests. Later that day at home Lolly was coming down from anesthesia, sleeping/lying down a lot, throwing up, seemed dizzy, had diarrhea, was panting. On the next day seemed very tired, was sleeping/lying down, refusing to drink/eat, panting a lot. On Monday went back to the vet to repeat the tests, x-ray showed less air in the bowels, thick bowel walls, blood-work showed dangerously low platelets. Further the vet established that diarrhea and throw up had blood in it (it was black, so we did not pick up on it on our own, now we know). Lolly was put on a drip and kept at the clinic for further tests. She was put on antibiotics and steroids (Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day). Platelets count went up, overall condition improved, on Wednesday she started eating on her own, on Thursday she went number 2 for the first time since Monday and there was no blood in it, so she was released home with the following prescription: Controloc Pantoprazole 40 mg per day (not to throw up other pills), after that in 30 minutes steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 35 mg per day and Remycin Doxycycline 300 mg per day. On Thursday 09/08/2018 steroids Corotrope Prednisolone were reduced to 25 mg per day. On 25/08/2018 a drop in red blood cells was diagnosed. New prescription was Controloc Pantoprazole 20 mg per day, steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day, Course of  Remycin Doxycycline 300 mg per day was completed and no longer required. A week after that, today on 01/09/2018 a diagnosis of Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia was given, a course of  Controloc Pantoprazole 20 mg per day, steroids Corotrope Prednisolone 45 mg per day, Hepatiale Forte 1 tablet per day (in order to protect liver) was prescribed, new appointment at the vet was set 1 month from now. During the appointment ultrasound was performed, enlarged liver was diagnosed (which is also visible, abdomen is enlarged) and impact to the liver was detected due to the steroids.  

At the moment Lolly seems to be not critical, but a bit tired, not very active (she used to play and run around a lot, she doesn't now), panting a lot, walking only for 10 minutes and rushing back home to the air-con, she has very good appetite, drinks a lot of water. Visibly enlarged liver gives us a great concern.

We requested all our data to be emailed to us, once it is done we will be seeking a second opinion, even though we do not have any complaints, our vet seems to be professional and caring (but what do we know?), we just need to be sure that whatever we are doing is right, nothing is overlooked, the diagnosis is correct, etc. Also, we currently live abroad in a small country with not many good  options regarding veterinary care (knowledge and equipment might be also outdated).

Therefor we are asking for any information helpful in this matter, please help! Anybody has any experience / knowledge in this area? What to do? What not to do?

"So my big boy 160lbs Bandit ate a whole salami roll yesterday by accident. I came home with groceries and as I emptied the bags on the counter he must have grabbed it (there is a reason why his name is bandit) without me noticing. I found the wrapper 10 minutes later on the livingroom floor and one happy looking dog. He was absolutely fine for 6hrs until bed time when I woke up in a puddle next to my head. A salami smelling puddle, I was very confused and thought bandit had thrown up but it was clear and just smelled like salami. As I'm walking over to bandit ro make sure hes ok i see him sleeping on his side and clear liquid (i asume pee) dribbling out of his penis onto him and the floor, he noticed 2 seconds later and started licking himself. I let him out and he went for a good long pee. After I let him back in, I change the bed sheets and notice him doing it again. I let him out and he goes pee again for a long time ( I watched him to see if he had to pee). This happened 5 times in the middle of the night over and over again. He would dribble a little as hes relaxed inside and would full on pee a minute long later outside. 

I'm thinking he drank to much water from the salty salami, but I've never seen him full on pee 15 minutes after he just went. His poo looks normal and he is behaving fine too.   Is this going to pass on it's own or do you think he needs to see someone right away?

"Not to long ago I started saving money so I can get a dog when I move to my own place In a few years, but was told (by people how know nothing about dogs just like me) that the kind of dogs I want would be unfit for the living conditions I'll probably have. There's nothing I want more then to get a dog, but if I need to wait 10 years until I have a bigger house then that's what I'll do. 

**Introduction**

 1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs

 * yes.

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

 * I would love to a rescue.

 3) Describe your ideal dog. 

* I mostly like medium to large dogs, with a medium coat (I think. Examples are golden retriever, German shepherd, border collie, Australian shepherd) . This is based on looks alone, since other than golden retrievers being friendly I don't know the personalities of dogs, and I feel that most websites don't do a good job describing them. 

 4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 

* pretty much listed adove. Also husky, but since I live in the middle east Im worried it'll be too hot for it. 

 5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

 * probably not more than the basics at first. 


**Care Commitments**

 6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? 

* around 3-4 hours I think, but Ill be home with him longer than that.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? 

* Im assuming I'll take it for a walk twice a day, and if its a breed that need more exorcise Ill find someone to walk it a third time when Im not home. And yes we will go to the dog park (as longs is it like to be around other dogs of course).

 8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? 

* as much as brushing as needed. I am open to doinf these things at home, but I think I migth mess it up, especially trimming, so Ill probably pay someone/get a more experienced friend to help me. 


**Personal Preferences**

 9) What size dog are you looking for?

 * as I said earlier fairly large. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

 * shedding is ok, just as long as its fairy easy to clean (does that even change between breeds?). Barking in general is also fine with me, just need to be able to train it to not bark at guests. Slobber I cant handle. 

 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? 

* I'd like that very much, but its not crucial.


**Dog Personality and Behavior** 

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? 

* snuggly 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

 * both I guess? I do need SOME alone time (not in a different room or something, just no playing with it) but I don't want to have to beg for its attention like with a cat. 

 14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

 * Its very Important to me that It will be (or can be easly trained to be) clam when visitors arrive and not jump on them. A good friend of mine is very uncomfortable with that and I don't want to be afraid to come to my apartment. 

 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

 * yes, but I feel that it's not a good idea since I'm new to dogs.

 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

 * I dont think so. Just not jumping on visitors. 


**Lifestyle** 

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

* In a week day probably a few hours. Ill try to use walkers and day cares as much as I can. On the weekend I'll mostly be home all day. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* um.. I cantnreally know right now. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? 

 * no

 20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? 

* nope

 21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? 

* I will rent, but obviously I dont know any of this stuff yet. Lets assume ther are no restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

 * No laws like that as far as I know. From Israel.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? 

* hot. Summer is usually 25-30 C°, but very moist (70-80%) so feels like 30-35 C° (all according to our weather website).

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/9b4n3h/discussion_just_moved_from_tx_to_pa_dog_ive_had/?st=JLJIQQWZ&amp;sh=2f0d0d9a

First and foremost, we HAVE scheduled a vet appointment. I was hoping this was a fluke but now that it’s been a minute he is going to be checked out by a veterinarian for any possible medical causes. Could use some support in the meantime however.

I have also switched from calling Samson’s problem “anxiety” to “fear” because I feel like that is closer to the truth. He doesn’t bark or chew things up or anything of the sort, he just tucks his tail and cowers.

Some background I didn’t give in the last post: Samson is a pit rescue from a kill shelter that was at full capacity when I adopted him. He was so fearful of everyone and everything that I was surprised they categorized him as adoptable and had to leave with him that day before they re-considered. This has never manifested through aggression, only through the cowering/tucking I mentioned above.

The shelter was unable to give us any information on him but I do believe he was an owner surrender in large part because he was already potty trained. Our very first adventure was de-sensitizing him to the presence of humans, and then dogs, and he never once eliminated indoors.

It was about two years later that we moved across the country and I cannot stress enough that he was exhibiting no signs of fear whatsoever at that point. I, and the people around him, considered him socialized and rehabilitated.

His first three weeks went even better than I anticipated. He didn’t like the busy streets and I didn’t push him on that. We walked along the residential ones and through a nearby retirement community. He loved meeting new people and smelling new smells... until this past week he suddenly just didn’t.

Someone asked in the last post whether I had a little patch of yard for elimination and I do! Initially when he was showing resistance towards going on long walks out through the back of our building I tried taking him out to the front, which I have avoided because the street is busier, and that worked. During this time we were doing some re-conditioning with treats and he seemed very amenable to the process.

One night I went out for three hours, got home around midnight. He whined to go out so I took him out front and he urinates. He whined when we got back so I took him out again and he did nothing before hitting his fear threshold and cowering before the door. My initial thought was that I had misjudged what he wanted so we went back in and he continued whining. I tried a few other things and eventually the whining stopped but when I woke up in the morning he had defecated indoors.

Because I was not the one to potty train him I know nothing for certain but can only judge by his reactions that it didn’t go well. The first thing I noticed when I woke up was that he wasn’t sleeping with me. He was in his crate and I couldn’t get him to come out.

The next day I took him out (w treats of course), he urinated, then came back in and defecated within thirty min. I did not punish him because I know he doesn’t respond to that sort of thing.

Last night I loaded up on more treats and cheap toys that he loves to tear up for more positive reinforcement. Again I took him out, he urinated, but I woke up to him having urinated and defeated in the apartment. At the very least he is reacting less shamefully to eliminating indoors, which I am happy about.

When we are inside and he hasn’t had a recent accident he is the exact same happy, silly dog that I know and love.  But as soon as I grab the leash it’s all far. I hoped it was a bad smell emanating from an overflowing dumpster but despite an initial improvement upon it being emptied this doesn’t seem to be the case.

Initially I was resistant to potty pads as it felt a bit like de-potty training him but do you think this would be a good idea? Any advice at all would be appreciated, I am not at a point in my life where I expected to be potty training a dog so I am not as familiar with this process as I would like to be.

She's a small dog and likes most dogs in my neighbourhood. Being agressive could also be a threat to her, since most dogs around here are bigger than her.

Any info on this will be helpful, thanks. ",dogs,[help] I’m about to own my very first dog
"1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  \* My husband and I both grew up with family dogs but we havent had any as adults. My mother bred Pugs and spaniels so I have a reasonable exposure to training etc (but again, not for quite afew years!) My husbands parents picked up some random 'pet shop special' mixtures - both of which turned into quite large boisterous dogs so hes concerned about this  

*  2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  \*  My husband would very much prefer getting a purebred so we know the dogs (likely) temperament etc (after his parents experiences..)
*  3)	Describe your ideal dog.  \* Affectionate and cuddly as well as independant enough to not destroy the house if left afew hours. Active enough to enjoy playing with the children/going for long walks but not requiring hours and hours of exercise.
* 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  \* Japanese Spitz - They seem a good mix, friendly and affectionate as well as easily trainable, their easy-care coat is a big plus too. A good companion from what I can tell. Schnausers - They also seem friendly and a good family pet (my husband likes their look!) But very open to suggestions!
*   5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  \* The basics - sit, lay down, heel, wait, roll over etc? \*\*Care Commitments\*\*

*  7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    \*  I go for a walk most days but could easily do 2 most days. (probably 90 mins total-ish) The children would play with the dog alot too but I wouldnt want to count on this as exercise.  
* 8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  \* I would prefer a reasonably easy-care dog. Brushing afew times a week would be fine, maybe a proper groom afew times a year but not much more than that.
*   \*\*Personal Preferences\*\* 
*  9)	What size dog are you looking for?  \* Small to medium (I dont want too small, husband doesnt want too big :P)  10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  \* As little as possible of all 3  
* 11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  \* Not terribly important, it would be nice to not have to worry about but also isnt a deal breaker at all.  
* \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  
* 12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  \* Snuggly for sure, lots of affection!  
* 13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?  \* Eager to please - But also would prefer one that isnt too likely to get anxious if let alone on occasion.   
* 14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?    \* Having abit of a bark would be fine but I dont want to have to worry about the dog biting or anything like that. A doorbell as opposed to an alarm system..  
* 15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?  \* No  
* 16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  \* Aggressiveness towards anything.   \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  
* 17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?  \* More days than not It could be around me - either at home or come with me to school pickups etc, on days it is left alone probably around 3-4 hours at a time.  
* 18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   \* The children are excited for pretty much anything, theyll have jobs like feeding (although obv if they forget itll be one me), my husband is keen for a pretty easy-care dog (he travels alot so most of the day to day will be on me though)  
* 19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  \* We have some tropical fish and 2 cats. One of the cats is a 12 year old birman and the other is a 2 year old Ragdoll - Shes pretty playful and will love having a buddy - her best friend for awhile was the neighbors freerange bunny..

"So let me just explain this a little more. I have heard so many stories lately of people getting dogs and then complaining when the dog...is a dog. Or the most frustrating, when a puppy is acting like a puppy. 

For example: A woman I'm in a Facebook group with is freaking out because her 17 week old puppy ""pushed over"" her young daughter. Well, a puppy isn't going to purposely push over a child. She's worried about her daughter being hurt. Well, if you were worried about that, then you should've gotten an older, well-trained dog or waited until your daughter was older to get a puppy. 

I get so upset with these situations because these dogs most likely end up getting re-homed, because they couldn't handle it. A dog, and especially a puppy, is hard work...it's basically like caring for a baby. They need attention and if you can't do that, DON'T GET ONE. Ugh.

Hey Reddit! Sorry for the essay. My partner (21M) and I (20F) are planning on getting a puppy post March next year. It'll be our second year living together, but our first year living together without housemates. For context: 

- We will most likely have a small yard, 3 bedroom house that we are renting (rental laws here say that you can keep a pet as long as it's reasonable eg. No Dane in a studio apartment, etc) 

- We are pretty sold on getting a German Spitz (Mittel) from a Registered breeder 

- We are planning on crate training, and setting up a 'puppy apartment for when we are gone (max 4 hours at a time and not in the first few months) 

- We have money put aside for maintenance of our future pup, including for a complete care membership for a vet/petstore which will give us unlimited vet visits, yearly dental care, free vaccines, and free puppy school. As well as discounts on grooming and premium foods

- We have a training plan, and we are firm on only using positive methods. 

Some more context: 

- We are both students (I know, huge alarm) but we don't do most things that students do. 

- We don't drink

- Social outings are at friends houses or at ours are very calm, and pet friendly (think movie and pizza nights, D&amp;D)

- We have good friends who are great dog parents and it'd give us a great excuse to hang out even more 

- I have experience in helping in shelters with training and socialisation, my partner recently fully trained his brother's dog, so we know what we're getting into 

- I am planning on getting my Cert III in dogtraining

-We are financially stable 

We have done hours of research on training methods, people experiences training and owning Spitzs, requirements from what type of grooming brush to use, to what is an ideal diet for their coat, health and wellbeing.

So me and my boyfriend have been taking care of Bennie for about 2.5 months now. He was a surprise dog; I went camping with a friend, and a stray dog with no collar or chip wouldn't leave our site. I couldn't leave him there, and no one came looking for him, so I took him home.

I didn't know he was part of the smartest breed until after I took him home, but he's honestly a weird one and doesn't really live up to his reputation. He's smart but not very energetic at all. He'll sniff dogs at the park but he doesn't know how to play with them. He's not neutered yet, so I'm wondering if once that's done he'll be less of an introvert. We give him a lot of attention and take him on decent walks, but he gets tired easily (not sure if it's because of his paws).

He's not super affectionate but he does like to be pet by us. However when we try and get him to jump on our bed to cuddle, he looks away from us. He seems not to want to intrude or something. Don't know anything about his history; there were some sheep and horse ranches around where I found him, so vets think he may have been a ranch dog.

I just wanted to know if anyone else had any other solutions. 

Also I want to note, I havent been able to take her on a lot of long walks bc the heat where I am is insane and it's just not safe for her to be out longer than neccessary. I know this could be a contributing factor to the problem behavior, but until it cools down I need some kind of solution. ",dogs,[Help] My female senior dog has gotten very humpy lately and idk why
"My wife and I have been having a hard time making this decision and I was hoping other peoples more objective opinions could help us. We recgonize our own bias and are so torn.
My dog PupPup(yes a super lazy name)is an 11 year old terrier mix that has congenital heart failure with a significantly enlarged heart that pushes on his trachea which only worsens his collapsing trachea and collapsing bronchia issues. We have him on various heart medicines as well as couph suppressant.
He has always been a lazy dog so its hard to notice how hes doing or feeling. Overall he seems to have become more lethargic and cant really go for extended walks anymore because he cant breath after a while and starts making a gasping sound with an goose honk cough. He also seems to be restless at night and often lays on the tile to try and cool down. We will hear him at night trying to get air as well as different parts of the day but its everyday at this point .
Other times he seems totally normal and eats food and water and will chase his tail and play, but his breathing seems to be getting progressivley worse and I'm concerned hes just suffering needlessly since his issues dont have a cure. 
Our biggest concern is we know hes going to succumb to his illnesses eventually but that could be who knows how long. Is it better to ease his passing now or do we wait until we somehow 100% know it is time. If we choose the latter it feels like we made him suffer so we wouldnt feel guilty and that is equally painful to us.

I'm just looking for peoples thoughts.

"I have a 9 year old standard sized, long-haired dachshund. We rescued her when she was a year old. That entire time, my husband and I have both always worked full-time jobs, so she is left at home for a majority of the day, and given copious amounts of attention when we get home.

For the last few months, my husband and I have been working from home a day or two a week, because our jobs allow us to do so. The problem we both have with her: she sits at our feet and cries. And whines. And cries. And jumps. And whines. She will do this for HOURS until we give her attention in the form of picking her up to sit in your lap, play with one of her toys, or getting up to get her a treat from the kitchen. Once you put her back on the floor, walk away from the game, or she finishes her treat, she goes right back to doing the same thing. Over and over and over.

I fully understand that this is a result of rewarding bad behavior over the years (mostly due to feeling so guilty for being at work all day). But now that we're both staying home (not at the same time), she's driving us both insane. My husband has a worse time with it, because she does that while he's on conference calls.

​

So I'm coming to r/dogs and asking my fellow owners, what can we do to keep her busy while I'm working?? You'd think she would want to sleep, but instead she has the crazy energy of a puppy that no amount of pre-work walking can flush out.

Does anyone have any advice as to things I can do to circumvent this issue? Or would it be better for me to continue to refrain from giving her anything?

"\*I'm curious if there are statistics or studies that show which dog breeds or types (if any) are most ""threatening"" to strangers on a walk or a home intrusion. Linking those would be wonderful! I also welcome personal anecdotes if you care to share them.

​

First, I'd like to clarify that I'm not looking for a dog that is actually aggressive. I have no intention of getting an attack or guard dog. I would love an alarm dog (my understand is most dogs are good alarm dogs) and be especially drawn to a breed that would bark its head off should an intruder ever come into my house. So a dog that is aloof with strangers but *not* human aggressive would be great for me.

​

You're also probably wondering why I am sounding so damn paranoid about an intruder or being attacked on a walk. I do have PTSD and now that I live alone, I get so fearful at nighttime that I can barely sleep. I also get fearful going on hikes since the trails are often secluded. I am going to therapy for this issue, but I think what would help me feel the safest is to get a dog that might ""ward off"" strangers. I currently have a small dog and her companionship has helped me tremendously. That said, she is very small and she doesn't make me feel any safer at home or on walks largely due to the stigma surrounding small dogs--people run up to her all the time, sometimes even pick her up and pet her without asking. I feel that wouldn't happen so often with a breed such as a german shepherd.

​

This brings me to my dilemma. I love herding breeds, specifically GSDS and belgian shepherds. I especially adore dobermans and beaucerons (if I could choose just one dog to have for the rest of my life, it would probably be a beauceron) . The problem is that all these dogs tend toward DA or SSA. Beaucerons in the US also tend toward HA. I don't need a ""dog park"" dog, but I would like to eventually have 3...or 4...or 5 dogs lol. So it is important to me that I get a dog that will enjoy living with several other dogs.

​

This leads me to think that I need to stick with sporting breeds and sighthounds. But those of you with experience with herding breeds, please let me know if you think any of them would be a possibility in my situation. I think a poodle could be a great option for me--I'm told they're rather velcro, biddable (I will do sports with the dog), expressive, and athletic. My concern is the stigma other people have for poodles. Would a poodle not intimidate an intruder or potentially ward off an attacker while on a hike? Again, I mean by appearance alone and do not mean for the dog to actually engage an attacker. I'm thinking a black poodle, shaved close all over, might be the most intimidating. But what if I ended up with a red poodle and wanted a [haircut like this where the body is shaved close but the ears are longer?](https://trainthatpooch.com/the-majestic-poodle/). I'm also interested in vizslas (not aloof with strangers but still might be intimidating?), GSPs (potential DA?), dalmatians (DA?), whippets (not intimidating looking)

​

I know, I know, ""any dog is a deterrent"". But my friend has a small dog and her house was still robbed while she was sleeping. The dog was barking at the intruder and they just ignored it. I truly feel a larger dog of a different breed would be more intimidating. Thank you for reading this ridiculously long post and I hope I don't sound too crazy. As for my lifestyle: I will be doing a lot of training and exercise with whatever breed I get. I currently walk/run on trails for about 5 miles a day. With a larger dog I would also like to start biking.

**​**

**TL;DR: Are there any statistics showing which dog breeds or types are most intimidating to strangers or intruders; also open to personal anecdotes. Dog needs to be relatively healthy breed and able to live in a house with other dogs. I am very interested in poodles but I worry they would not make me feel any safe than my small dog just due to the way some people perceive them**

"How did you treat your dog with seasonal ear, nose and throat allergies?

We have been to the vet multiple times for our dogs allergies (ear, eye and nose). A few reccomened benadryl and the latest gave us apoquel. I don't understand his reasoning behind giving us apoquel when she doesn't have any skin issues at all. She has no bald spots, she isn't red, she doesn't dig, ect. Also, the long term effects from the medication are not good. Anyways, we can not afford to spend 300$ at the vet every month and 100$ more on medications. Benadryl doesn't seem to work and now we are trying vets best seasonal allergy from a pet store (some people have said it worked some said it didnt).

"We have 5 border terriers. Every morning and night after they eat breakfast and dinner, we hide treats all over the yard -- along the fence, around the patio, under and on the patio furniture, around shrubs. We get 10 treats and break them up and hide those pieces. 

When we start to let them out, we get them to the door and all excited (barking, turning, scratching at the door) and as soon as we open the door, they fly out. They all scatter different directions, noses to the ground, looking for the treats. They usually find almost all of them, and have learned over time to get really good at this.

"**Introduction**

Teensy bit of context: I've been mentally/emotionally ready for a dog for two years now, since I finished undergrad. But I'm just about to move from the US to the UK for a 1 year graduate program. I do not plan on getting the dog until the program is done, I'm just excited and anticipating. Depending on employment status, I may remain in the UK and get a dog there, or I may move back to the US and get a dog here.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* Yes, but for the last year I've been primary caretaker for my parents' 11 yr old labradoodle, for 2.5 years I worked at a dog daycare and volunteered at the city shelter, and for 4 years I've been a dogsitter. I also interned with a dog trainer doing puppy classes.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* First dog, probably rescue because I'm ready for a dog and know that purchasing from a breeder can take months to years. I'm also not sure I'm ready for puppyhood.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Young, energetic, comes with or easy to train an off switch, cuddly, handler engaged, smart/innovative (yes I know...). A dog who will encourage me to go run in the morning and then sack out on the couch. Dream right now is a border collie (if in the UK) or an aussie (if in the US). Both are readily available in rescues in those locations and have the get-up-and-go I'm looking for. But those are both a lot of dog.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I LOVE herding dogs. I love their focus and drive and the problem solving attitude they bring to everything (even if there isn't actually a problem to solve). I'm also a big fan of terriers. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Probably start in rally-o but I'd love to do agility and/or obedience. In the future I'm interested in bitework and herding but those take more time and money than I think I'll have in a year. This in addition to standard obedience and any tricks I can think up. As above, I'd like the dog to run with me so good leash manners will be a priority.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 30-90 minute run (depending on where I'm at in my plan) plus 1+ hour walk, plus 2-4 (depending on where the dog's at) 5-10 minute training sessions. If (as is likely) I'm in an apartment, as many potty breaks as needed, and meals will almost certainly be done in a puzzle toy. So total, minimum of 1 hr 45 minutes of one-on-one interaction every day. Usually at least 2 hours.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I already go for a 1 hour walk a day and additionally a half hour run every other day, both of which the dog will be welcome on (once manners and joints are up to par for the run). Also a weekly dog sport. I have had good luck historically with dog parks but if the dog's not interested, that's fine too. On weekends when the weather is good, I go for hikes.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'm open to hair trims and ear cleaning at home. I'm also willing to go to a groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium! Most apartments here have a weight limit around 50-60 lbs. I don't know about the UK but some time in the dog's lifespan we'll be back in the US. I'm not a big fan of tiny dogs, so at least 10 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is no big deal. Excessive barking is not my favorite thing, but I don't mind warning barks or quiet grumbles. Not a big fan of slobber.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Nifty if we can do it, no big deal if we can't.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggles! My parents' dog likes personal space and I really want someone to cuddle with.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* ... both? I want a handler-focused problem-solving dog. So more on the eager-to-please, but not to the point of stupidity.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* A few barks and then a controlled greeting. I don't want a stranger-aggressive dog, but I can manage and train either excessive greeting or fear. I would like a dog who warns me of approach. On walks, ignoring strangers would be excellent.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Yes

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Separation anxiety. My parents' dog has it, and it really makes it hard for me, as an anxious person, to leave her alone without feeling guilty. I don't want to feel guilty! I know that a lot of handler-attached dogs are SA prone and I'm willing to do some work initially, but as a rule, no big hysterics when I leave.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* This is the mystery. I'm not going into a field with a lot of standard 40 hour work weeks, but I just don't know.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* When I get the dog it'll be just me. Eventually I'll move in with my girlfriend, and she also likes smart active dogs. She'll be the backup but I'll be the primary caretaker.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Girlfriend is going to be getting a cat.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* As a rule, US apartments don't like bully breed mixes, GSDs, or other stereotypically dangerous breeds. I've also found they tend to have weight limits around 60 lbs.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Next year, Edinburgh UK and yes, no pits. After that, Tampa Florida, and not to my knowledge.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* In Edinburgh it'll be about 15 C (60 F) in the summer and 4 C (40 F) in the winter. In Tampa, 85 F (27 C) in the summer and 65 F (18 C) in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* I know I have a big life change coming up. I'm willing to wait until I return to the states to get a dog. I also know things will shift based on my rental status and employment. I'm just trying to get a sense of whether the breeds I'm interested in would be a good fit for me--and what others might work too.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.

"** Hi! I am looking to get a puppy sometime in the next couple of months, however I cannot decide on a breed. Australian shepherds catch my attention the most, but I worry that I won't be able to fit their activity requirements. I plan on doing lots of exercise with it but everything I read about the breed makes me worry that I won't be enough for it. I've taken various quizzes but I always get small breed dogs, which I'm not really interested in.. Idk, I've answered the subs questionnaire below **

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have always grown up with dogs so I'm not exactly sure how to go about answering this question, I have never had a dog that was solely my responsibility. I always helped in potty training and used to attend training classes with my cousin and her dog, which I plan on doing with my own as well.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* At the moment I think I prefer the idea of going through a breeder, however I'm not opposed to rescuing or adopting from a shelter, I just find it to be more difficult. In my area the majority in shelters and rescues are pit bulls, which I adore, but sadly the majority of homes in my area will not allow the breed.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My only real set in stone idea is a female medium/large breed. I love the look of a merle Australian Shepherd, and I will always be a sucker for blue eyes, of course neither of these are requirements for me. I also would like something with the same fur length as an aussie.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* As I stated above, I have been highly interested in Aussies, but the activity level is what worries me.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Of course, I plan to train basic commands such as sit, roll over, lay down, etc. I would also like to teach more advanced things like how to put away toys or jumping through hoops and stuff, I do plan on taking classes to help.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I am a college student and a part time waitress. I work Saturday-Monday with a maximum shift of 5 hours. I have school Monday-Wednesday for a maximum of 2 and a half hours. In future semesters I still plan on spreading out my classes enough to spend time with pup in between. I will be walking before and after work and classes.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I plan on walking 2 or 3 times a day. Around my neighborhood. The closest dog park is about an hour away so I could make that work once a week along with the occasional hiking trail.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am more than open to fully grooming myself, well, I would need to learn how to properly do ears as that is something that would worry me. I do not mind going to the occasional groomer.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* I would like a medium/large sized dog. Nothing smaller than an Aussie, nothing near the size as a Great Dane.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I don't mind shedding and I can deal with barking, however I would prefer a dog that does not slobber/drool obsessive. I understand it as an occasional thing but I can't deal with constant drool lol

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* This isn't something important to me. I worry about animals running in the road so I would always have mine leashed in my area. My boyfriend lives more in the country so as long as my dog is properly trained to be off leash and come when called I could deal with being off leash there. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I'm a sucker for snuggles. My dog doesn't have to be under my feet 24/7, though I wouldn't mind if they were. But I would like a dog that wouldn't mind cuddling with me at night.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* I'm not sure how to answer this one either. I don't mind my dog doing whatever (as long as it's not destructive) when I am doing something around the house or homework or something, but I would like for them to be responsive and cooperative when asked to do something like sitting or coming when called.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind barking when someone knocks or enters my yard, as I know it can actually keep burglars at bay at times. I do want my dog to be friendly towards others and show no aggression. I know this will require socialization on my part.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I would prefer my dog not be aggressive towards other dogs. I know this will also require socialization on my part. Once I graduate college and get my own place I'm sure I would get more dogs and possibly a cat as my boyfriend is a cat person. I'm studying veterinary so I'm sure I'd come home with animals in that profession lol.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing else that I can think of.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* As I stated before, no longer than 2.5 hours at a time on the days I have school and no longer than 5 when I have to work. I do plan on taking a week off the week that I get a pup.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* None of my other family members really care too much, it's just my mother and two younger siblings. My siblings would surely love to play with it and I could help teach them a little of responsibility by letting them help me care for it. I would like to think my mom would help with walks if I can't but I can't count on her for that. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* I would like to have more pets in the future, but that will be a while from now. My cousins have a mix breed and a chihuahua we would do play dates with though.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* I have a 7 and 8 (almost 8 and 9) year old brother and sister but they are the youngest in my family.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent at the moment and will probably rent for the next couple of years. As far as I know my current place has no restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

Some of you might’ve seen my post a few days/weeks ago about this, but now it has a part two. This disgusts me. This is animal abuse, and people are too ignorant to see that and it got so popular to warrant a sequel. It sickens me that people can’t see how abusive and unhealthy these corgis’ lives are. Assuming this is how they always are with each other, this is torturous to them. I don’t get how someone can think this is cute or funny. Would they also think someone punching their dog and the dog yelping is cute and funny? How revolting. And to add insult to injury... now I’m no health expert, so I could be wrong, but those dogs look *heavily* overweight. Very unhealthy.

We are looking at getting our 1st dog (both my husband and I had family dogs as children but not as adults) and would love to get some advice on which direction to start looking into!

Our 5 year old son has just been assessed as being a 'high emotional needs child' so thats definitely a factor but we were talking about it abit before that too. We have an 8 year old also.

I'm home most of the day, most days (while my husband travels for work often so is away alot), so I would love an affectionate buddy to have around (although obviously Im not home 24/7 so dont want a dog that will destroy the house if its left alone more than afew hours on occasion). I'd likely do 1-2 walks on weekdays and on the weekends we like to do a decent walk in the bush/at the beach etc as a family.

We have 2 cats which we've had for years. Our house has a big backyard and is fully fenced.

Would prefer one that doesnt have any intense grooming needs. 

So overall - a good family dog - very affectionate and cuddly but also keen to play with the kids and get out for some walks with me. Happy with loads of time around people but also wont wreck the house/backyard if its alone for an afternoon..

"Stella is a really well trained rescue dog. I have only had her for 3 months. She knows sit, stay, down, jump, speak, shake. She doesn't counter surf, drink from the toilet and only dumpster dives when nobody is home. She walks with a loose leash until she sees another dog... then she goes into full on puppy-mode, jumping and pulling and barking and circling. But she is not a puppy; she's a 90lbs Labradane and has over 300lbs of pulling force. 

We started with a prong collar per her rescue recommendation, but it cut up her neck due to missing hair (allergies). So we have been using a martingale instead. Every time we see a dog, I make sure she has seen it for a second, then I get her attention back on me and treat her. Right now we can get within 100ft of another dog before I nearly dislocate my shoulder. 

It's just so discouraging to have major slip-ups, like last week when I didn't see a puppy until we were at the top of a hill and Stella dragged me to the bottom of the hill. Today it was dark and I didn't see the dog until 30ft away. The other Lab just walked right past us like we weren't even there, meanwhile Stella is doing the mambo on the leash.

Hi guys. So in the future I want to someday get a dog. (Definitely not in the near future) but i always like researching dog training methods and have become a bit confused and lost now. I’m getting two very different methods. There is the positive reinforcement method and a dominance or “natural” method.

 they seem to be at odds with each other.  I have recently found a dog trainer that suggests the more gruff and dominant training style. I personally have always sided with positive reinforcement but the dogs she has trained seem totally fine and socially with people and other dogs, great even. They seem well behaved and obedient. How is that achievable?  

It really confuses me because when i looked into dominance training usually the outcome is a scared dog scared of its owner. Yet its not the case? They have put up quite a few video showing their dogs behavior and how they train them. I wanted to know though if her methods are a good idea. Show you mix methods? Should i just stick to positive reinforcement? 

Heres an example of her training: 

(Socializing with unfamiliar animals)
https://youtu.be/vg0C34V4xZU
You could watch the whole video but 2:14 is a good start to see what the training method is like.

At 0:48 is a good start just to show how her dogs act with other dogs

(Dog disciplining)
https://youtu.be/1mBz9OFujyE
5:20

My goal with this post is to have a conversation about the two methods and why and how they are effective. I really want to believe that positive reinforcement is the way to go but seeing her dogs act so nice seems odd to me. It makes me think maybe thats also a good training method.

"Tl;Dr: my rescue dog was extremely overweight when I got him. Is there any advice anyone could give to help him lose weight?

Hello there! Around 3 years ago I received a Dachshund named Harley from my extended family. At the time when he arrived he was ~39lbs. Extremely overweight. Could only walk for short distances and it broke my heart to see him in such a condition. I learned that his previous owners had fed him not just scraps, but entire meals fit for human consumption, and tons of fast food.

I don't have any pictures of him on hand when he was that large but believe me when I say he used to look like the Dachshund from this video

His current pictures: 
https://imgur.com/a/KPcysGg

After 3 years he's come down a lot on his weight near half, we're about to go for an annual checkup and I'll know his actual weight then. He's able to run now and even plays with our Chihuahua. However him losing has been stagnant for a while. We took him off human food when we got him and  he's been on small dog breed food. He gets fed twice daily, but likes to sneak to the big dogs bowl and grab a few bites. I'm writing now to hopefully get some advice from y'all. I'm going today to buy a small pool for him to practice water exercises, and I plan for more trips to the local dog park when my work and school schedule frees up. 

Is there any sort of meal plan that would help him get to a more ideal normal weight for Dachshunds?

Any specific exercises to help his movement and breathing without over exerting him? 

Lastly is there any sites anyone could link me to for more information about on dog weight loss?

Sorry for yet another MY DOG BARKS TOO MUCH post, but I'm really out of ideas. I absolutely DO NOT want to put a basket muzzle on my dog, but I don't know what else to do.

Quick background: my dog is a 6-yr old Chihuahua-Jack Russel mix. I rescued him from a shelter who had him for a few years because nobody would adopt him. He was abused as a puppy and skittish of everything and has AWFUL separation anxiety.

He's crated with my other chihuahua mix for 10 hours during the work day (split into 5 hour parts, thanks to dog walkers). Whenever someone comes home, either when the dog walker picks him up or when I get home from work, he barks incessantly from the second he hears the front door knob turn until someone tells him to be quiet. The crate is in the living room so it takes about 20 seconds or so until I'm able to quiet him down. I can only imagine what the neighbors think during those 20 seconds (especially if I'm out at night and it happens at 1-2 AM).

Ignore him when he starts barking, then shower him with affection once he quiets? Tried it, he just kept barking and barking. Eventually my other dog started barking too.

Exercise him more? I take him for a 30 minute walk before I leave for work (around 8:30a), and he gets another 30-45 minute walk with the dog walker (around 1:30p). Doesn't help.

Leave toys in the crate? This dog can care less about toys, even if they're stuffed with delicious treats.

Work on his separation anxiety? I took one month off from work to work with a dog behaviorist and help his separation anxiety, that's $1000 I flushed down the drain.

I'm on the verge of letting this dog go, but I really don't want to. The barking isn't the only reason, but it certainly doesn't help. If I surrender this dog, nobody will ever adopt him again, and I don't want him to die.

I can't bring myself to put a basket muzzle on him - especially since he's already in a crate. But I'm at a loss here, I've tried so many things and nothing helps.",dogs,[Help] What options do I have for a rescue w/ awful separation anxiety that barks when I arrive?

"So about 4 months ago my husband and I adopted a pittie mix, female, spayed, 2 years old. We don’t know much about her history, except that she’s been in various shelters for the majority of her life. She’s very sweet, sassy and has begun opening up to us a lot more. Love her to bits. 

She has some idiosyncrasies, like she does not like being touched in her abdominal or back leg area by your feet, especially when you have food. So I assume she was kicked badly multiple times, though she doesn’t have any injuries from this. She doesn’t bite, just barks and backs away. Similarly, she hates black dogs, possibly because her kennel mate was a black dog who had left a lot of bite marks on her when we adopted her (a while other story).

She’s generally a good sleeper at night, and her bed is next to ours. (Yes, we tried a crate, she wouldn’t even enter the room even for fave treats and cried when we tried to coax her; we decided it wasn’t worth her emotional anguish, please don’t lecture on that) Like most dogs she dreams and while usually they’re nice dreams where she’s relaxed and just making cute whooping sounds, sometimes she gets growly or worse. 

This has happened twice now: she bolts up into a run from a dead sleep. The first time she was pointed longways in the room and ran and barked for a couple feet before waking up. Last night, she bolted up and straight into the mirrored closet door. Aside from having the ever loving shit scared out of us, nothing was damaged and she was fine, but shaken up. Soothed her and she went back to sleep. But is there something we can do to try and cut down on this? I don’t want broken mirrors or dented walls, which is a real possibility since she’s 50 lbs of pure spooked pupper. I don’t really want to put her on anti-anxiety meds as she’s normally very calm and doesn’t have other anxiety issues. Is this just a matter of waiting it out and letting her issues get forgotten, or???

1. **Cocker spaniel rage -** I keep reading snippets on various websites about solid-coloured cockers having an issue with rage. I am aware that it's a very rare genetic thing, but other than going to a reputable breeder, is there anything else I can do to avoid dogs with this condition?
2. **Colour vs. Temperament -** Other than the rage condition, does the coat type (solid/parti) really have that much of an effect on the temperament? A breeder with whom I spoke told me that I should avoid solid cockers as it's going to be my first dog.
3. **Trainability -** I had previously also shortlisted golden retrievers because I had the impression that they're more suitable for first-time owners. I'd prefer a smaller dog, though, so could someone please give me an indication of whether cockers are relatively okay to train? 
4. **Stubborn/attention-seeking behaviour -** People keep telling me that their 'friend of a friend of a friend's cocker spaniel' used to chew the walls/attack other dogs/tear the curtains/run away/etc. Not sure what to think of these as they're stories from people who don't actually own cockers.

Luckily I was already having a hard time sleeping, so I got her out and washed her and dried her the best I can and placed her in the playpen.. She is currently crying and I read that I'm supposed ignore it, but I'm having a hard time just leaving her there.

So what I need help in is trying to break her out of the bad habit of peeing/pooping in the house, I've been as vigilant as possible and have caught her in the act and try to take her out side, but she wont go unless she's in the house. Also, do I ignore the crying?

"So, yesterday our Dog killed a stray Kitten. 

I've always been a cat person, never really been into Dogs but this one had grown on me over the last 5 years I've known her. 

My wife once had another dog that belonged to her ex who was a trained cat killer, and I once came home to him killing a kitten and almost killed the dog myself out of anger. I didn't harm him, but I never looked at him the same and didn't shed a tear when I learned that he had been killed by a car (ex took dog back a few years ago). Fuck that puto.

My wife called me crying her eyes out yesterday and told me what the dog had done. I was calm when we spoke but have been angrier at the dog since.

I don't want to walk her, talk to her, look at her. I know it's fucked up but all I want to do is beat her ass. I won't really do it in all likelihood, but I can't help feeling like it. 

We had developed  good relationship with daily long walkies, but all I see now when I look at her is red.

We have 4 cats that she doesn't bother, but had it been one of them I'm not sure I could have stopped myself from putting her in the doggy hospital or worse going old yeller on her ass. 

How do I get past this? I really don't want to hate her for the rest of her life like I did the other dog.

I know it's her nature but it makes me want to puke.

"One of my three dogs, Arai, is obsessed with anything spheroidal. Dog balls? Yes. Basketballs? Yes. Horse balls? Yes. Melons? Yes. If it's spheroidal, she wants it. She usually has one in her mouth.

Just about a month ago now, Arai got her tongue stuck inside a hard rubber ball from BarkBox Super Chewer subscription. The ball had one hole about 1cm wide. She had a fairly large (but proportionate) tongue, and when she bit down on the ball, the one hole created suction, sucking her tongue in. Because it was a super chewer ball, it was hard and she couldn't get it back off.

Because she always has a ball in her mouth, we didn't think anything of it until she wouldn't put it down to eat (food &gt; balls). It was on there ~6h (less than most people are gone for work every day). We tried to get it off, first relieving the suction by drilling a hole, and attempting to use oil to lube it off - it wouldn't budge. We rushed her to the emergency vet, where it was removed under sedation. Over the course of several days and many trips in and out of vets' offices, we were finding her to be getting worse and not better.

After a trip to UC Davis, we learned her tongue had necrosed due the loss of blood flow because of the tight fit of the ball on her tongue. She had to have 9cm of the end of her tongue removed (by laser!). All of her vet care amounted to about $3000USD. She will never be able to clean herself again. She will never be able to cool herself effectively ever again if she gets too warm. She has had to learn how to drink and eat with half her tongue gone.

We reached out to BarkBox and found out the ball was supposed to have a ""plug"" in the hole - this is a common design for their products, a squeaker plug in a hole of a ball. They were so apologetic and empathetic.

They are going to reimburse us for the cost of her vet care for this injury, and are sending items for her new special needs (a special watering dish and a cooling mat since we're moving to a hot place for the military). BarkBox has been prompt and sincere in making sure this situation is taken care of correctly. Although I wish it hadn't happened, I'm so glad they stepped up and are doing the right thing.

Be aware of balls with only one hole, because although it's kind of a freak accident, it can cause serious consequences. And before anyone says it, yes, we take responsibility too for not keeping a closer eye on her. We do and will continue to ache over our contribution to her injury.

Love your dogs. Play with them. Keep an eye on them. I don't blame BarkBox but I appreciate their taking responsibility and attempting to right a wrong.

Edit to add: I wanted to share this so as many people as possible know that this kind of thing can happen. I don't want anyone else's baby to become permanently altered/injured. Arai was lucky, but another may not be.

I figured some of you may be interested in this article written by Dr. Linda Case. It was shared on Facebook by Dr. Patricia McConnell, that's how I found out about it. I hope my title was worded appropriately and not in a biased way.

Quick and brief overview of the article:

Dr. Case talks about what taurine is, as well as how diet may influence taurine status. She also briefly talks about what breeds and factors may predispose a dog to having taurine deficiency.

Dr. Case explains that, as far as we know, it seems like the dietary factors that may be associated with DCM in dogs are similar to the ones in cats, which include foods with ""low protein levels, poorly processed or heat-damaged proteins \[...\], and the inclusion of a high proportion of plant-based protein sources such as peas and legumes."" She also mentions that specifically in dogs, other foods associated with DCM include ""lamb meal and rice diets, soybean-based diets, rice bran, beet pulp, and high fiber diets.""

We all know how highly debated dog diets are within the dog world. Ultimately, this seems to be the advice given by Dr. Case: ""a recommendation is to feed a food that contains sufficient levels high quality, animal-source protein, does not include plant-source proteins as its primary protein source, and does not contain high levels of dietary fiber.""",dogs,"[Discussion] ""The Heart of the Matter"" - short article by Dr. Linda Case about taurine-deficiency DCM and how it may be correlated to some grain-free foods"

"This is kind of a long story, so I apologize in advance for the amount of text. See the TL;DR for a summary.

​

So I took in a dog last week.

​

I've been wanting to adopt a dog for a few years now. I'm finally at a point in my life that I can have one, so I've been looking at shelters in my area for a dog to fit my lifestyle. Recently I found this dog at a nearby shelter and took immediate interest in him. He's a 7 year old dog, which seemed perfect for me since I work full-time and therefore don't have enough time to train a puppy, but have the capability to have him with me at work if he's well-behaved. According to his profile and the shelter, he's a very sweet and calm dog that is friendly around people. I met him last week during a visit to the shelter and confirmed that he is in fact a calm and sweet dog. He seemed like the perfect fit for me. Since I took him in, he's been an angel for the most part. He usually is very calm, as the shelter suggested. He doesn't bark or pull on the leash. He's house trained already. He's been friendly towards everyone that he's met so far.

​

When I showed interest in this dog, the shelter told me they would like me to foster him first, since he has a few medical issues that they wanted resolved before letting anyone adopt him. Initially this included finishing up a heartworm treatment and getting a simple surgery done to remove a growth in his year. After I took him in, it became clear pretty quickly that there is a lot more wrong with him than that. He has a laceration on his eye from a dog fight he got in at the shelter, as well as a torn eyelid from the same incident. He has a cough that causes him to throw up multiple times a day. He has a yeast infection on his skin that makes him itch constantly. He also has a severe ear infection from the tumor, which I found out yesterday (from the vet) that is potentially malignant and could require a full ear canal removal if it's deep enough. All in all, he's got a lot of problems. I don't mind treating them, since he seems like such a sweet dog, but now I'm not so sure. He does growl a bit when I give him his eye drops, but hasn't bitten me yet. I haven't tried cleaning his ears yet, since I only was told yesterday at the vet that I need to start treating the infection he has as well (I was told not to previously since the infections are coming from the tumor and it is supposed to be taken out next week).

​

I took him to the vet yesterday, and things kind of fell apart from there. I took him out to go for a walk before leaving to take him to the vet, but he ended up having an accident at the vet. While there, the vet told me about the tumor and the yeast infection and the ear infection that all need to be treated. Then, when I got him home, he peed inside my apartment. As I have been doing since I got him, I took him out before I went to bed around 10:30pm. He's never had an issue holding his pee until the morning, but during the night he peed again. When I woke up and saw it, I immediately tried to clean it up, he was sort of standing in front of it, so I grabbed his collar to pull him aside so I could clean it up, at which point he attacked me. He bit me several times on my right arm/hand and once on my left arm. The bites were deep enough that the fat underneath the skin was exposed. My roommate called the paramedics and then took me to the ER. I'm all bandaged up now and have been set up with some antibiotics for the next few days, but now I need to figure out what to do with the dog.

​

This is the first time I've been bitten by a dog (I've grown up with them my whole life so this was surprising to me, even if he is a shelter dog). I'm not sure what set him off, really, and that concerns me. Part of me thinks that it was taking him to the vet that upset him, since he didn't start peeing inside until then. I was warned that he doesn't like the vet much, but while we were there he didn't seem too agitated aside from peeing on the floor. Another part of me thinks it's the medications he's being given (eye drops twice a day, eye lubrication twice a day, ear wash once a day, ear drops twice a day, 2 kinds of pills twice a day, and more to come) and he's frustrated with being poked and prodded constantly. If it's either of those two reasons, I'm at a loss as to what I should do. He needs the vet visits and he needs the medications in order to get better, but providing him with either of those things makes him dangerous enough that he'll attack anyone who gets too close. If his aggression isn't related to the medicine or the vet visit, I'm concerned about him attacking someone again for an unknown reason. I'm not really sure what to do now. Do I keep working with him and hope something like this doesn't happen again, or do I bring him back to the shelter? He needs help, that much I know. I don't want to give up on him, because he seems like a sweet dog, but I'm also worried about putting myself and others at risk. What should I do?

​

​

TL;DR My foster dog bit me several times today when I tried to clean up his pee. The bites were severe enough that I had to go to the ER. This is the first time he's shown this level of aggression towards me or any other person at the shelter he came from. It might be related to the large amount of medications he has been taking (being fussed with too much), or to a vet visit from the day prior, or from some unknown reason. I'm not sure whether to keep fostering him, which potentially puts myself and others at risk, or bring him back to the shelter and hope he finds a home that can handle this kind of aggression.

​

EDIT: spelling and grammar. oops.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Thank you for all of the responses, everyone. I've dropped him off at his vet and he will be picked up by someone from the shelter tomorrow. Based on all of your responses, it's likely that he will do this again, and unlikely that this behavior can be trained out of him considering his age.  It's unfortunate that things didn't work out, but based on responses in this post and advice I've received from every friend and family member I've contacted about this issue today, sending him back seems like the right choice. Luckily, I'll be sending him back to a no-kill shelter. I notified them earlier today about the incident, so they know to watch out for that in the future (I also notified animal control as well). However, the woman I spoke to isn't convinced that he's a risk to people, but thinks that he's simply in pain because of his medical issues. I hope that they're able to fix him up and find him a good home that's willing to take on an old dog with his kind of behavioral and medical record.

"Hello! I had a quick question that I was hoping I could pose to the group before I call my vet in the morning. Ultimately, what I'd like to know is if it's safe to use the Seresto collar on my dog. Quick info on my pup:

- She's 13 years old
- Cockapoo
- Weighs ~35lbs
- Is on pimobenden and lasix for congestive heart disease (has been since July of 2017)
- Has had heartworms in the past (she's a rescue, and was treated back in 2010 when I got her), and because of this has a slight heart murmur
- Eats normally, poops normally, drinks normally... sleeps a lot, which I expect is normal for such an old girl.
- I don't give her dog treats - she instead gets sliced fruit (apples) and raw carrots as treats. I don't see the need to add any sodium to her diet given the heart disease.
- Doesn't spend a lot of time outdoors. She goes out 3-4 times a day to do her business, and then she'll lounge on her bed and snooze the day away.
- Her bed is located in my bedroom, in the immediate left corner. There are no toys loose in her bed, and she never gets into my bed anymore (hardwood floors - I'm worried that at her age, if she ever tried to jump off, she'd hurt herself).

I am currently dealing with a flea infestation. In the 8 years I've had my dog, she has never had a flea infestation this badly. A little back story -

- 2 weeks ago, after realizing that she'd been itching for a week or so, I brought her to the groomer. She's had fleas before, and in the past, it's always only been - off to the groomer, shave down, flea dip, capstar, and start the monthly flea drops until the temperature drops. That always managed to take care of the issue. This time it is WILDLY different.
- While she was at the groomer, I fogged the house with Hot Shot foggers. After a few hours, I came back, opened the windows and vacuumed. After I picked her up, I put a new flea collar on her (I forget what brand now - I wish I had kept the damn tin, but I do know it was not a Seresto collar) and put some Hartz flea drops on her back. I also, for the sake of being thorough, threw out all of her old bedding and bought her a new bed, and myself new sheets (as is the norm for me the one time a year she usually gets fleas). Since I had not noticed anything out of the ordinary, I assumed the problem was nipped in the bud and would be taken care of at that point.
- Over the next few days the problem got SIGNIFICANTLY worse. I couldn't leave my bed without fleas jumping on my pants. Over this past week and a half, I have put out 5 flea traps, spread diatemaceous earth ALL over the bedroom floor, have bathed my dog with Dawn dish  soap, and have been vacuuming religiously - to the point where I don't enter or exit my kitchen without vacuuming it first. The fleas appear to be concentrated to the bedroom and the bedroom only! My living room and home office are virtually unaffected. The kitchen I honestly don't know, because it is the first room you step into outside of the bedroom. 
- It has been 3 days since I put the DE down and 4 days since I set out the flea traps. One thing that is striking me odd though is that my dog sleeps on the immediate left side of my room, and only leaves her bed to eat, drink, beg me for my dinner, and go to the bathroom. She never goes to the right side of my bedroom - never. 
- Last night I noticed something. The flea trap that is less than a foot from her bed caught the usual couple dozen fleas. The one on the RIGHT side of the room though... had caught HUNDREDS if not over a thousand fleas last night. The three prior nights, it had not caught anywhere NEAR that many, not even combined. It was like the flea god himself came down and said ""WAKE UP"" and every flea under the sun jumped into that flea trap. It was SO BAD that I put a cookie sheet down just to expand the trap area. This morning, after changing the trap water, I put a second cookie sheet down. There are now three traps on the right side of the bedroom, continuing to catch fleas as we speak.
- I have NO IDEA and I am extremely puzzled WHY this would be happening on the side of the room where the dog never goes. I can vouch for that being true too - I work from home, and for the sake of not spreading fleas all over the house MYSELF, I have spent every day of the past week and a half in this room with her. I also don't understand why THAT MANY fleas showed up just overnight! I mean, what!

Anyway! This weekend, I have a plan. After a week of reading everything I could find on flea infestations, I decided that tomorrow (payday for me), I'll be ordering a Seresto collar, 6 doses of Capstar and a flea comb. The plan is to bathe her again, take her outside, give her a Capstar (which I plan to give her everyday for the whole 6 days - then follow up with the Seresto collar on the 7th day), and spend the next however-long-it-takes amount of time combing her thoroughly. Once I'm confident that she has no more fleas on her, I'll take her inside and put her in her crate to quarantine her for a few hours while I deal with the bedroom. I'll also be buying a brand new vacuum cleaner (one that is not specifically made for hardwood floors, but instead has multiple floor settings and good suction power and crevice/upholstery attachments). Then I'll be sweeping up all the DE and vacuuming the hell out of the bedroom. At that point, I'll be bleaching all the floors in the apartment and letting them dry. Then, I'll be buying Precor 2000, which I intend to treat the bedroom floor with. 

I'll be continuing the regime of vacuuming constantly, because what the hell, I've been doing it a week and a half now, why stop until this is over, right? 

This entire experience has been a nightmare, and I really have just a few questions before I call my vet -

- Is the Seresto collar safe to use on an older dog with heart problems? If not, should I use the K9 Advantix instead?
- Will the bleach kill the adult fleas or larvae or anything? I have researched and can't really find a definitive yes or no. 
- Is all of this overkill? I feel like I'm about to wage actual nuclear war in this bedroom, but the fleas are so bad that she and I both are uncomfortable as hell.
- If you'd like to see pictures of the flea traps from last night - the left side (her side) vs the right side (the side she's never on), I'd be more than happy to post those so you can be disgusted along with me.

Sorry for the novel, but man, I just had to get all of this out. I am exhausted, mentally and physically and I just want to know that there is a light at the end of this hellscape tunnel in the relatively near future.

PS: A few other things that might be of note, I have no idea, but since I've written a ton already, I might as well include it:

- I live in a 150 year old house. My apartment is the 2nd floor of said house. There is one other apartment below me. There is one floor above me also, three rooms, that no one has been up to for nearly three years and the only way in is through my living room.
- There is one storage room at the end of my bathroom hallway, left exiting the door of my bedroom. It shares a wall with the right side of my bedroom. Again, no one goes into that room - it is full of empty boxes and old toys, records, etc, from the people who owned the house before my landlord. The window in that room was broken at one point earlier this year, but has since been blocked off. This was months back, February/March I believe. I have no idea if any critters managed to nest in there during the time the window was broken because as I said - I never, ever go into that room, and no one else has access to it.
- From what I've heard, the insulation in the wall between the storage room and my bedroom is horse hair. Again - 150 year old house.
- About 4 months ago, my downstairs neighbor had been saying his son was complaining of flea bites. They have no pets. Two weeks later, my dog was groomed (she's groomed every couple of months), and the groomer let me know that she had no fleas, but she did have three ticks removed. This problem started about a month AFTER that. I have no idea if my neighbor has a flea problem or not.  
- The basement of this house is a dry dirt floor, which has not been treated for pests to the best of my knowledge, since February of this year. I also don't believe the yard has been treated. The previous owners of the house used to put lime (lye?) on the basement floor and around the perimeter of the house, monthly - he said to control pests. I don't know.
- The house has significant vegetation and several trees around it, however the bushes/grass/weeds/ivy up against the house have not been trimmed down since February, when the new owners/landlords took over. Only the front yard is cut, weekly. The rest of the yard, including all the vegetation right up against the house, grows wild.
- As far as I know, my immediate right and left neighbors have no pets. I don't know about the neighbors behind the house. There is a stray cat that used to wander the yards every once in a while, but I haven't seen it since last summer.

There. I THINK that's everything. If I think of anything else, I'll let you guys know. But I am all ears if anyone wants to chime in on this situation and give me advice, be it on the collar or the fleas or if I'm doing ""the most"" or not doing enough.

"I have heard and seen great things regarding exercise equipment for high energy dogs. But I was wondering if a DogPacer or cat wheel would be appropriate for a toy breed, and if so, what precautions I should take.

We take two 30-min walks per day along with backyard potty breaks and playing inside. A few times a week she gets to run around my parents' backyard.

" Hello everyone, I just wanted some advice on my terrier interacting with a new set of kittens.

​

So my baby Zenobia is amazing, she's precious and high energy Irish terrier mix, as best we can tell. We have had her since last December, and she has lived with our two cats since then, and loves to play with them (they do not enjoy it) and herds them around when they are being bad. She is around other cats at my grandmother's house when she is babysat there, and that cat is huge, and isn't afraid to yell at her and smack her about if needed, so she has a healthy interest in cats, is desperate to play and be played with, but has come to understand they are peers not prey.

​

My mother and I recently rescued some baby kittens, VERY young, we think three weeks when we found them. My mother has been fostering them and so they have grown up with her two massive dogs (who love and mother them) so they don't know fear of dogs. It's been several weeks and they are probably about 8ish weeks old now, about to go to the vet to confirm this week. I asked my mother if we could take one of the kittens when they are ready for adoption, and she agreed, but since i already have two cats, making sure that Z got along with the new baby was important. So tonight we packed up, got on our ThunderShirt, took some doggie calming meds, and went to greet the kittens.

​

At first she was just too high energy, overwhelmed with the kittens and smells (she has been to the house many times before, just not since the babies arrived).

I do want to be clear we have done cat introductions numerous times, all safeguards were in place, the kittens were not in any danger, to put anyone's mind at east.

We gave her a break, and tried again, always having her on leash and thoroughly controlled while kittens were being handled by me. We gave treats for calm interactions, and praise. She was better. But a few times she lunged/nudged at them and we would correct the behavior. In turns she was nervous, excited, and uncertain, and we tried to praise her at the appropriate times, letting the kittens climb on her to get her used to it, play with her ladybeard, and all of that she was good with, but when they would hop and move fast then she would get tense again. She did lots of good smelling and appropriate licks.

"We adopted a two-year old female pom-shepard (no idea how this happens) from a local animal sanctuary and for the last month she's been a submissive mess. She's had a great loving environment with soft voices, reassurances, treats, etc. for over a month and her behavior doesn't seem to have changed even a little bit.

1. Anyone approaching her results in her dropping on her back and urinating all over the floor with her tail between her legs.
2. She doesn't like going outside. She will hide under the car until you let her back in the house. Any attempt to coax her out with treats, ""good girls"", pets, etc. just results in her rolling on her back as though you're about to start beating her.
3. Nobody has given her any reason to act this way since we adopted her. There's no yelling, no punishments (even if she gets into the trash or urinates on the floor). Just calm assurances and pets and laying around the house.
4. The only time this seems to change is when our blind yorkie-poo comes near her; often she will turn aggressive and begin growling at him. She has tried to nip at his head once when he got too close.

We don't really have the full backstory, but what the previous owner said was that she has always been incredibly submissive and was ""at the bottom of the totem pole"" around the sanctuary. Other animals included dogs, cats, donkeys, and goats free roaming; cows, pigs, and horses in pens.

She was covered in fleas and terrified of everything when we picked her up. She doesn't make a single sound unless its whining when you leave her alone in a room. 

Can anyone provide some context as to what we're dealing with and whether she can be brought back to happy doggo status? Or is this basically a life-long trauma she's got?

"Hi!

TL;DR: where do I start to train my fearful 3yo heeler mix to walk beside my confidently and distraction free? 

My partner and I adopted a 3yo Heeler Mix last week and she has been an absolute sweetheart. Alice was found under a roadway (texas gate) out of the city with an injured puppy. She had no tattoo or chip and was in the shelter for about a month. They had no idea how long she had been stray. 

She seems to be well trained in everything but walking. She goes to her crate at night, never has to be locked up, only pees and poops outside, and doesn't beg or grab food. 

That's all we know. When we walk her she seems overwhelmed by traffic, people, dogs. Our area is very busy and she constantly stops to watch cars and people. She smells everything along the way. Then she will get to a certain area where she just will not go further and wants to turn back despite any amount of encouragement and treats.

I'd just like to know where to start in helping Alice conquer her fears. We are slowly exposing her and letting her walk as far as she can without forcing her to go further down the block. Treats aren't able to get her attention or motivate her on walks. I'm afraid when we take her to new places or the vet, she will just lay down and refuse to go with us.

I've seen lots of training videos for puppies but I'm not sure how to tackle fear/distraction with an older dog. 

Thanks for any and all advice!

"Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs? - This will be my first time being the sole caretaker for a dog but I have years of experience sharing responsibility when it comes to pet care.

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder? - I would prefer a reputable breeder.

Describe your ideal dog. - I would like to be able to come home to a dog who will cuddle me to death but also is independent. I look for strong personality and high intelligence. Ideally I would like to train for obedience, possibly agility or other sport, but I also will need a dog who knows when to be active and knows when to chillax while I am gone at work. I would like a companion who can travel on the road with me, get along well with other animals, and live in a small to medium sized home or apartment.

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? - I am interested in Italian Greyhounds, Whippets, Dobermans (though I hear they have complicated health). I think their body conformations are beautiful and they are easily adaptable to their environments. I also think that they would take well to training.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do? - Run/jog with me, hike with me, basic obedience, possibly agility.

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day? - Any time I am not at work. I plan on being able to take them with me where I go if it is appropriate.

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park? - I love dog parks, I love taking walks and hikes. They would be walked approx three/four times a day and hopefully I will have a good sized yard or field near by for them to enjoy some zoomies and a good game of fetch.

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly? - I don't have any problem with at-home grooming. I can do it myself.

What size dog are you looking for? - Medium to large, but not too large. I could have a big dog so long as they are well behaved. I am a fairly petite person and I want to be able to adequately handle the dog.

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle? - Shedding doesn't really bother me, barking does. I don't mind barking when it is necessary but otherwise I am not a huge fan. Slobber is also something I would like to avoid.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area? - Very important.

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space? - Snoogly!

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? - Mix of both. I don't want to constantly have to pay attention to them but I do want a dog who loves and listens to me and shows it.

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors? - I would prefer them to greet visitors kindly but I also would like to take comfort in knowing they would protect me if they needed to.

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? - I would definitely prefer not to have a dog who is aggressive towards other dogs so that they can come out on the town with me and enjoy other dogs' companies.

Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid? - Aggression.

How often and how long will the dog be left alone? - For some hours during a usual work day. But plenty of time will be spent together after work.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? - It's just me!

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they? - Eventually I would consider having a cat or other dog. If I got another dog I might consider getting the same breed.

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly? - No.

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease? - I plan on renting in the future. Not ready to settle down quite yet. Not sure of what those leases would look like.

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds? - I currently live in Illinois but plan on moving. Probably back to Oklahoma in the next year or two. No laws banning breeds that I know of.

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live? - Usually in the high 70's- mid 90's.",dogs,[Breed] What breed is right for me?

So, I’ve been thinking about getting a dog for quite awhile now. I have never owned one (have 2 male cats), but I have a very active lifestyle and have been thinking it would be awesome to have a walking/running buddy to come with me everywhere.

I saw an Italian greyhound out when I was at a coffee shop and couldn’t get over how cute and funny it was! From what I’ve read, they are very difficult to house train; however, as a nurse I’m fortunate enough to be home 4 days a week and my fiancé is able to work from home often. We are also moving to a warm climate within the next year (I would get the puppy after we are moved) which I read they are more favorable to. Our home is near a dog park as well!

What I can’t seem to find is if they are friendly with cats! My cats are rambunctious; they are like puppies that can climb on everything. I am not sure how a puppy/dog of this breed would react to that? 

I’m not rushing to get a dog; I want to do more research and learn how to train it properly, but I am really excited nonetheless! Anyone have any experience with this breed/how they interact with cats? Thanks so much for your help!",dogs,[Breeds] anyone have experience with Italian Greyhounds; are they cat friendly?

Took him to the vet a week ago and they said it was some kind of skin infection. He was given two weeks of antibiotics but they don't seem like they've done anything so far.

"Hello, just putting this question out to see if anyone has had a similar issue that happened to both of their dogs at the same time. I'm not overly worried yet.

I have two 40-pound mini-Goldendoodles (3&amp;4 years old) that are well trained (partially because of their extreme love of food). Up until maybe 2 weeks ago, when I would say ""breakfast/dinnertime"" they would both go crazy and run to their bowls and patiently wait for it to be filled. Then when I would tell them to eat, they would eat right away and finish it all.

About 3 weeks ago, they both caught ""colds"" (I'm assuming from one day they spent in a trustworthy kennel that I've used before). They had runny noses and were sneezing a lot with occasional reverse-sneezing fits. They've been over those colds for about 2 weeks but have been uninterested in their food ever since (they've been eating various kinds of Blue Buffalo their whole lives). They have been eating one of their two daily meals on average. The annoying part is that they are still very much interested in dogs treats and human foods. I have been withholding all food except their Blue Buffalo for the past several days just as a test, but it hasn't changed anything. If I sit down with them to do tricks, they will eat the reward treat, but if I try to give them the Blue Buffalo as a reward, they will spit it out. I opened a new bag of Blue Buffalo of a different variety, but they are still uninterested. They usually go crazy if I add water to the food,but they don't care about that either now.

Yesterday, I didn't give them dinner, and didn't give them breakfast this morning. They had normal, playful energy throughout the day and their poop has been normal looking. I gave them dinner this evening, but they were still disinterested in it. One of them ate all of it, and the other laid down next to it for a few minutes, then ate about half of it. I can’t imagine they both just became picky eaters at the same time.

I'll probably take them to the vet in the next few days, but just wanted to see if anyone had a similar experience with both of their dogs at the same time. Thanks in advance.",dogs,[Help] My two dogs are suddenly uninterested in their food

"So I just posted this on Facebook, but I think you guys will give me some better insight into this. Maybe I'm somewhat in the wrong here or could have done better here. 

For context Zoey is a 4 year old Border Collie. Cooper is a 1.5 year old GSD/Husky. He had a GSD mix that was off the bat showing some not cool signs (came in with hair up, was growling as they sniffed, telling the  dog immediately to be nice) which is why I originally tried to get some distance. He also had some sort of lab mix that was not directly involved. 

Begin rant. 

Today I took Zoey and Cooper to the dog park. Zoey loves the park, but can also be SUPER possessive of toys (especially balls). Since this has been an issue in the past, and because the parks are literally covered in discarded toys, I kept both of them in the separate ""shy dog"" area until the main area cleared out. Once it was pty I brought both in and we hung out for a bit, until a man showed up with his two dogs. 

When he entered l the very first thing I said to him was ""she's not good with toys, she gets very possessive, just a warning to you and your dogs"" and he tells me his get like that too.  Hes trying to chit chat and follows me while I'm walking over to the other side of the park to get some distance and next thing I know he picks up a ball and starts throwing it around right in front of Zoey and his own two dogs.   

I have LITERALLY JUST SAID my dog is possessive. He LITERALLY JUST SAID his dog is also possessive. Can you guess what happened next? 

No dogs were hurt, but I'm still so upset at this. I don't know what possessed this man to just blatantly not listen to what I told him, and put both of our dogs at risk of injury. Of somebody tells you their dog has an issue like this please listen. 

If he had not followed me to the other side of the park and kept some distance everything would have been fine.

Hello,

My girlfriend and I adopted a border collie mid last month. So far, we love our puppy, very smart! But I do have some questions about her peeing. When we take her out to pee, it seems like she does not want to pee everything out at once. Not sure if this is common for certain puppies, but our poodle, even at a young age, would pee everything out in one go. Our puppy collie could hold it for at least 3-4 hours if she wanted too, but it seems like she chooses not to. Couple things I am wondering if these are normal for collies:

1. She will pee for half a second outside, on the grass and won't go again unless we take her back outside in 20-30 minutes.
2. She only pees in one spot, our front lawn, no other grass areas, just that one spot.
3. Since she only pees in that one spot for a split second, she will not pee anywhere else even if we walk her for an hour (same with pooping)

We have given her so many treats and positive reinforcement when she pees outside, but the moment she steps back inside, she pees. Could be a span of 10 minutes or if lucky another hour. We have tried limiting her water, but same result. We do not want to constantly have a timer every 30 minutes to take her out to pee. I was told a 3 month old puppy could at least hold it for 2-3 hours. When shes in a kennel for 4 - 5 hours, she does not pee inside it.

"I have a 9 year old yellow lab that has spinal arthritis, she's had it for at least 4 years and had been doing well on glucosamine enhanced dog food, as well as supplement tablets.

However recently she developed an allergy to glucosamine, and we can no longer give her either the food with it already in it or the tablets. She's been noticeably groaning every time she stretches or moves compared to before we stopped giving the glucosamine to her.

About a month or so ago she began licking various parts of her body raw, and we hadn't changed any of the foods that she was being given.

When we cut out the glucosamine, the licking completely stopped, so we figure she has developed a shellfish allergy in that time.

She was also fine being left in her kennel for the 4 hours my husband and my work hours overlap. She went in of her own accord, chewed on her toys and was fine. Things seemed to be good.

But now she's feeling at home, and a flip has switched.

She has been jumping up on people when she greets them, barking, going after my cats, refuses to go in her kennel and will whine and bark. We live in an apartment building so this is a BIG issue. 

And the one that bothers me the most, she has started going to the bathroom inside in a willful fashion.

We take her out for bathroom breaks CONSTANTLY because we are still trying to show her the stairs aren't scary, outside is good etc. So she goes out at 7am (I leave for work) 9am, 11:30am (husband leaves for work) 2pm (I come home on my lunch break and then leave again) 5pm when I come home from work, and then I watch her and see if she gives any signs to go out during the evening before bed.

For the past several days, I will literally bring her upstairs after having been out (and she went!), and she will find a place and poop or pee. 

We spoke with the vet who saw her last week, and they assured us that she was healthy and would have nothing physically making her do this. They are saying that she is acting out because she's bored in the apartment. 

The problem is, she won't walk. She won't get further than maybe 50 feet from the door before she plants her legs and refuses. I would LOVE a walking buddy, we have great trails right next to our building and I was hoping for a dog who wanted to walk. I've tried treats, I've tried waiting her out, she won't budge. I've even tried just standing outside with her so she can sniff around, but she goes straight for the door. To clarify, there is a busy main door to the building, but we lucked out and are right next to a back door that no one seems to use ever, so we take her out there where it's quiet and there are no cars, people or dogs to frighten her. It leads out into the woods so there should be plenty of nice smells but she's not interested.

And as for the pooping/peeing, we were told to start kenneling her for about ten minutes after we get inside to differentiate that bathroom breaks happen outside, inside is for sleeping. But as I said, she will howl and bark and we don't want her to think we are letting her out because she whined enough.

My husband and I have had various shepherds and collies, so we're used to active breeds who need a lot of mental stimulation. We thought we could work this out with long walks and maybe an agility course once she's comfortable. But since she refuses to go outside for anything other than the bathroom, of course she's bored and acting out. 

We are going to continue working on getting her comfortable with walking, but in the meantime we need to make sure she doesn't destroy our apartment or get us in trouble with her barking.

Are there any puzzles, toys or games that will help her with mental stimulation? She's happy to play indoor fetch, but again we have apartment neighbors.

And just to clarify, my husband and I are not giving into her stubborn bids for the upper hand and we are disciplining her (not yelling but firmly letting her know) that barking, pooping, chasing cats etc. are not to be tolerated. Since she doesn't want to go outside, that gives us plenty of opportunity to train her on commands.

She also loves her Kong chew, bone stuffed with chicken, tug rope and tennis balls but we can only do so much with those inside.

**TL;DR: Adopted a dog that needs tons of exercise and mental stimulation, but refuses to leave our apartment. What toys/games/puzzles can I use to keep her entertained before she destroys everything?**

**EDIT:** We do not allow the dog out near the cats without supervision. The vet said a month or so of growing pains is to be expected, but we have discussed the possibility of what we need to do if she cannot get along with the cats after that period.

My one cat couldn't care less and stands up to the dog if she barks or tries anything, my other cat has been safely quarantined until the dog gets under control. He loves having a space to himself.


**EDIT 2:** We are 100% taking her to a positive trainer as soon as she is acclimated, I am just trying to lessen the indoor accidents and barking in the meantime.",dogs,"[HELP] I have a dog who needs to be mentally stimulated and exercised, but absolutely refuses to walk or be outside for long.

I just took Brady out and he peed then pooped then kinda wiped his bottom on the grass and then walked around and went to poop like three or four more times but nothing really happened. There was like a mucus kinda stuff and I got a little worried. I told my brother about it and he said that Brady did the same thing early this morning when he took him out. Should I call the vet and tell them about this or wait it out and see if anything changes.

"TLDR - little Shih Tzu terrorises our neighbourhood, owner refuses to leash it on walks and even picks it up and cradles it like a baby after it lunges at my dogs aggressively.

Hi all, 

I have 2 sweet dogs - a 3.5 year old Golden Retriever, and a 2.5 year old Goldendoodle. They get a little excited when out on walks but nothing I can't handle. They are friendly and affectionate 99.9% of the time (doodle might come off as a little aloof to humans sometimes) and all our neighbours love them. 

The problem is that one of our neighbour has a little Shih Tzu that is quite aggressive. My dogs have gotten charged at 3 times now, and the Shih Tzu usually likes to target my Golden specifically. Once after getting snapped in the face by the Shih Tzu, my Golden considers it to be her arch nemesis and she absolutely hates this dog. I usually turn around and walk the other way when I spot this Shih Tzu in the same park when we're out for walks. Nothing happens if the Shih Tzu fails to spot any dog, but if he does spot a dog, he starts barking and growling and lunging, and it triggers the other dog. I've heard of other neighbours getting attacked too, so it isn't just my dogs. 

Once, the Shih Tzu charged at my dogs and I leapt in front of my dogs to protect them. When the owner finally caught up to us, she picked it up, cradled it and started cooing at it in a baby voice saying, ""It's okay, you're okay. Don't be scared."" She offered no apology at all.

This morning during their morning walk, we ran into this Shih Tzu again. The thing about going to the park is that we use a shortcut to get to it. It's like a little alley about 13 - 16 ft, so when we're using the alley, we can't see if there's anything waiting for us at the end of the alley until we emerge from it. Just as we walked out of the alley, that little dog came barrelling towards us and we were caught off-guard. This time, I didn't have a chance to react and by the time it registered that this was the demon dog I usually avoid, there was already a fight going on. The owner was calling for their dog but that little Shih Tzu is untrained, has no discipline and didn't even turn its head to the sound of the owner calling it off. The owner came running and actually slipped and fell on the pavement. I have no sympathy at all. 

We managed to escape, and in my hurry to escape from the demon dog, I didn't confront the owner about their off-leashed terror. This is now the 4th time my dogs were attacked by this Shih Tzu. No injuries on my dogs as far as I can tell (my dogs seem extremely satisfied and happy after the fight though.). 

It is illegal in my country to have an unleashed dog and it can be reported to the authorities. I'm just wondering if I should go ahead to do it. I don't want to sour the relationship between neighbours. But I'm seriously thinking I should report them. 

The problem is that the owners don't think their dog is the problem. They cradle and coo it and treat it like a real baby. That dog has zero discipline at all. My dogs are bigger and most people have this idea that big dogs are aggressive and if a big dog and a small dog were in a fight, it is almost always the big dog's fault. It is so frustrating. 

Anyone met with this kind of situation as well? Any advice? All discussion are welcome. 

I shall include pictures of my dogs here if anyone wants to see:

"This evening I took my 7 month old GSD pup to the apartment dog run. We had been there for about 10 minutes before another woman and her dog showed up. 

We'd been together in the dog park several times before, and our dogs got on well. The new dog was very active, sprinting around, having a great time.

About 10 minutes into the play session, the two dogs were chasing each other around at the far end of the dog run. The other dog made as if to turn, and then collapsed howling and screaming with pain.

At first myself and the other woman, the dogs owner, were both frozen. My dog had been a few steps behind the other dog and didn't seem to have touched her. What could have happened.

The dog continued to scream and we both snapped out of our shock and ran to her. I pulled my dog away, and tied him to a tree, then went back to help.

The woman was clearly panicing. Her dog was screaming, unable to stand. She seemed unable to move her back legs.

I tried to calm the woman down as best I could. I agreed to hold her dog still while she ran for her car. 

While she was gone I attempted to sooth the dog while also figure out what had happened. There were no visible signs of injury, however she appeared unable to use her back legs. I attempted to splay her toes, but got no response from the dog. Lifting and dropping her tail also elicited no response. When I ran my hand down her spin, I could feel a small bump. Almost a deviation of the spine not far from the base of her tail.

I would guess that I sat holding the dog for about 10 minutes, although it felt longer.

When the woman returned I helped her get the dog into her car. I didn't know what to do. I had my own dog to think of, still tied to the tree, but wanted to offer to drive her to the vet. The woman seemed on the verge of total panic. Instead, I just asked what I could do to help her. 

She said she was okay to drive and was going to get to the vet as soon as possible. I nodded and let her go. I didn't know what else to do.

All I can think of is the sound that woman made when her dog collapsed and she realized something was terribly wrong. 

All that woman wanted to do was spend sometime playing with her dog in the park after a long day of work. Now she's at the vet, dealing with what I can only hope is temporary paralysis.

I hope the dog is okay.

"Love this questionnaire! My husband and I are looking to add to our family and would love some suggestions. I've pointed out what we are leaning towards, but I've never had a dog before so I've love some more opinions. 

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be our first dog, we’ve had cats up until now. I’ve dog sat most of my friends dogs at some point or another, border collie mixes, goldens, Brittany spaniel, Springer spaniel, lab, bichon, etc

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Kind of cat like, lazy to a degree, independent but still wants to be with their people

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Greyhound has been at the top of our list because of their personality and activity level, 45 mph couch potato. I think we could be open to other breed types. I want a larger dog, something 35+ pounds. I love our friends’ Brittany spaniel but our other friends have a Brittany/springer that’s a spaz that I’m not a huge fan of, tho my husband likes him, he’s a cuddler once he calms down. My husband also loves bulldogs, but I hate how stubborn they can be, and they have a drooling problem. I also like a well-trained lab (extended family has one) as well. My aunt has had a dalmatian (it was older and I really liked it when I was a kid), beagle (not a fan) and other family members had small white dogs (maybe a bichon) that I hated too. I think I didn't like them because of their lack of training tho. My grandfather had a mix that was the sweetest. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* The normal, sit, wait, to walk on a leash without pulling, not to jump on people, etc. Nothing too serious, mostly just basic stuff.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Several Hours? Not sure how much or how little I should devote to this, coming from the cat world. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Walks mostly, greys don’t do well in dog parks which is what I’ve pretty much based all my opinions on thus far. I’d say 1 – 1.5 hours total of walking. I work at home so going out a couple times a day is no problem. I did find some active greyhound groups for group meetups. One meets at an indoor enclosed equestrian center and has a lure setup for some running if they wanted which is totally neat. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Regular brushing is no problem, cleaning ears is cool, but the rest I’d want to pay someone. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Larger, 35+ pounds. I want a dog that’s a dog, can’t be smaller than my cats and nothing yippy which I tend to associate with the smaller toy breed groups anyway. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Shedding is fine (read again, cats), low barking and low slobber would be ideal

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important. I suppose it would be nice, but really anywhere we’d go, laws require a leashed dog and I hate it when I’m hiking or something and a random unleashed dog walks up to me. I don’t know if they are friendly or not. I would not exposure others to that. I would prefer that they would at least be good at recalling back to me if for some reason they got loose accidentally or spooked at something. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I’d prefer personal space, my husband would prefer snuggly

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* In the middle? Eager to please seems like they’d need attention ALL. THE. TIME. And I don’t have that in me, but I would like them to enjoy being with me. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Leary but not scared about it. I would be fine with barking at door knocks/door bell ringing, but not at every single thing that moves outside.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I’d rather not, all my friends have dogs and they run the spectrum on their ability to interact with other dogs. I’d want one who was good with them, we live in a very dog friendly city so we’d prob take the dog out with us a lot if they could handle it, so people and other dog friendly would be perfect. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Nothing that training couldn’t correct (do not jump on people, my #1 pet peeve)

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Rarely, a couple hours a day, both my husband &amp; I work at home, but go out to dinner regularly and run errands after work. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* My husband pretty much agrees with me unless I highlighted something above, we will both be the primary caretakers of the pets. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes, 2 cats. Our cat of 14 years recently passed away and we’re ready to add to our family again. We wouldn’t add a dog to her family because she’d been alone with us for 12.5 of her 14 years and that would have been unfair to her, but we’ve been thinking about it for years now. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No. Yuck. Children.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent now, but are buying a house in the next 6 months, currently we’re not allow the “standard” aggressive breeds, pit-bulls, akitas, etc.  

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* None that I’m aware of currently. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* I live in North Carolina, so highs are in the high 80s during the summer months and lows are in the 30s in the winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* Being okay with cats is pretty important to me, we don’t have the cats yet, was thinking getting the dog first would be ideal so we can train him/her beforehand and the interactions with the addition of cats would be less stressful for all involved. Thoughts on this?

"Hello r/dogs, I could use some advice. I work for an animal shelter/hospital, and we recently got in a very timid, matted dog. An hour into her shave down, I realized how skinny she is, and then realized how pregnant she is!

 She's terrified of people but shows no aggression, and seems to enjoy being pet once she relaxes a bit. I decided to foster her not only to socialize her, but to make sure she isn't so stressed and alone during the pregnancy.

She's basically about to burst, and I'm concerned about how skinny and malnourished she is. I'm afraid for the health of her and the puppies. Does anybody know a safe and healthy way for her to put on weight quickly? Also, any other tips (socialization, birth, etc.) are very appreciated.

"I submitted a post awhile ago about me and my GF breaking up and how to deal with the dog and I thought I'd give a small update for and I had a few more questions which if you want you can just skip down and read. If this is against the rules I apologise.

So without getting to deep into it, my ex cheated on me and left me but long before that we had gotten a dog together. Naturally we got pretty heated talking about who was going to take the dog and even almost went to court. Thankfully we eventually settled on me keeping the dog.. almost. 

I own the house we lived in, it's the house Vi (the dog) has grown up in, I have a fenced in back yard and 14 miles of trail to explore. She now lived in a duplex in the middle of a city that doesn't allow dogs, but she is cheating the system as they allow you to have service dogs, but she has a doctor's note for a comfort animal and I'm not sure her landlord knows the difference and she has also gotten a new puppy. The arrangement now is every so often I would meet her at a dog park and she can play with the dog for a few hours. It is my fondest hope that she eventually moves on and gives up on this but still every now and again brings up how she ""could have taken me to court and gotten the dog back weeks ago"". I think the odds of me winning in court are 99 to 1 as I have a notarized bill of sale for the dog as well as the state registration. 

 For me the only thing that sucks with with me keeping her is I work 8 hours with a 45 min commute to and from work. Most days a buddy who lives down the street from me is coming over most days and letting her out to potty but there are 1 or 2 days where I have no choice but to leave her home for 10 hours. I live out in the middle of nowhere so there isn't any dog walkers so I'm hosed there, I can't afford doggy daycare.

 So far on those days she has done fine, I have a camera in the house so I can check on her and all she does pretty much the entire time I'm gone is chill out on the couch with the cat. So that leads me to my questions.

1. How bad is it to leave her alone for that long? I'm working on a permanent solution, and in a year or so am planning to move closer to work but for right now I don't have a ton of options. 

2. How long does it take for me taking care of the dog by myself til she has no more grounds to dispute the dog, all she had is the Doctor's note and she handled the vet bills which I have since took over. After she broke up with me she had moved out into her new place in less then a week and I have been taking care of the dog for almost 2 months now.",dogs,[help]Dog ownership after a breakup
"Hi there. I'm currently 5 days into 15 days of dog sitting my friend's french bulldog while he's on holiday abroad. I'm (of course) a huge dog lover, and after having both my fur babies pass away this year I was excited to have a dog in the house again for a while. However so far I've found it quite difficult.
The dogs I've raised in the past have all been terrier breeds and I understand Frenchies have much different personalities. But I also know that my friend hasn't focused on training her since she was a small puppy (she's about 11 months now). The dog is used to going potty indoors, but I live in a rented apartment with carpet so I'm letting her outside constantly - there's only been one accident so far. 
But the major thing is she's VERY vocal, and I'm afraid it's going to upset my neighbours (we have thin walls). She whines constantly. Now, I have been walking her twice a day (double what she's used to getting usually), feed her on a schedule, give her plenty of toys, lots of attention and petting, brushed everyday - but still she whines and does the squeaky bark, usually at the door or at me.

I have fostered two dogs with separation anxiety before, and I don't believe this is what she's experiencing. If she whines at the door, I assume she needs to use the potty so I let her outside. About 15% of the time it is for that reason, but the other times she just stands out there and sniffs/snorts or barks. Like I said I live in a rented apartment, and the garden area is not secure enough for me to let her roam out there on her own. 
I don't want to be too strict with her as I know she will be going back to her home where there are few rules, but I want to know if there's a way I can teach her to be a bit quieter?

Cheetah conservationists encouraging the use of LGD among African farmers, seems to be going pretty well. I haven't seen any articles about this in the sub and thought it was neat. :)

&gt;The dogs are placed with a flock when a few weeks old to bond with the livestock. They live permanently with the animals, loyally heading out with them every day to deter hunters, and bedding down with them at night.

&gt;Marker's centre started breeding the livestock dogs to promote cheetah-friendly farming after some 10,000 big cats—the current total worldwide population—were killed or moved off farms in the 1980s.

&gt;Up to 1,000 cheetahs were being killed a year, mostly by farmers who saw them as livestock killers.

&gt;But the use of dogs has slashed losses for sheep and goat farmers and led to less retaliation against the vulnerable cheetah.

&gt;We see about 80 to 100 percent decrease of livestock loss from any predator when the farmers have the dogs,"" said Marker.

"My 3 yr lab/mix Clyde has chronic pancreatitis.  It flares up every so often.  He's on a prescription diet and is never allowed human food.  This weekend my wife and I were at a friend's house catching up with some friends we haven't seen in a while.  Their back yard is fenced in and we let Clyde roam free. He was in eye sight the whole time and was generally well behaved.  We think his pancreatitis was flaring up because he started to eat grass and leaves, which he usually does when it flares up.  This time, he ate leaves from a fig tree.  I was able to stop him after he ate a few and didn't think anything of it.  About 30 minutes later he comes over to me and throws them up.  That was a sign that something was wrong.  We asked our friends what kind of tree it was and they told us fig tree.  We left their house, got into the car and googled if fig tree leaves are toxic for dog - they are.  Aside from throwing them up, he seemed fine (energy was normal, no diarrhea, etc.)  

It was Sunday and our vet was closed so we called a sister vet that was 24 hours.  They said bring him in and we made an appointment. On the way there, we got a flat tire which added about 10 minutes to the trip.  We got him to the vet, they did an exam and ran blood work.  The blood work came back with very high lipase levels, a sign his pancreas was in trouble.  Some liver enzymes were also off because of the toxicity.  They gave him charcoal to absorb the remaining toxins that he didn't throw up and wanted to admit him given his high lipase levels. The vet was very direct (and cold) with us and said it could be fatal because it wasn't his first flare up and the enzyme levels were really high.  We agreed to admit him and have him stay for a few days. We left terrified that we would never see our sweet boy again.  

We visited him the next day (Monday) and he seemed a lot worse. He appeared depressed.  He didn't wag his tail when he saw us, had no energy, didn't care that there were squirrels outside (a huge sign), and wasn't eating.  We visited for an hour and tried our best to get him to do anything.  Nothing worked.  We left feeling worse than the day before and couldn't stop crying.  We called our regular vet who reassured us that he would be involved and in contact with the sister vet office everyday.  The next morning (Tuesday) we got a call from the overnight vet saying that Clyde had improved and he would be ready to come home that night.  They told us after we left the first night, he wouldn't stop whining and trying to get out of his kennel.  They told us his demeanor changed as soon as we left, he was energetic, and they thought it was him just wanting to go home with us (who knows the real reason).  That day they transitioned him off of IV fluids and he ate two meals and was able to go to the bathroom.  We picked him up Tuesday night and we had our normal, happy, energetic pup back.  We took him to the pet store to pick out a new toy and went home.  It's been one day and everything seems back to normal.  

It's hard to describe that feeling while he was gone for 2 days.  Our house felt so empty and there are thousands of things that reminded me that he wasn't there.  Things that I didn't expect to remind me he wasn't there and also didn't expect each of them to hit me like a truck.  Like walking from my kitchen to the living room and turning the corner to see his toys on the floor just sitting there, or leaving for work and having to unlock the door, when I usually unlock it when I take him on our early morning walk; I just stood there and stared at the lock for what seemed like an eternity.  My heart felt so empty.  But he's back now and everything is normal and we are relieved.  

&amp;#x200B;

As a final note, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the staff that took care of him, especially two vet techs, Danielle and Lauren.  That office was so busy that day and they were so positive and supportive, and they did not rush us at all.  

Thanks for reading. I had to share. I'm going to take Clyde out for a walk now. Cheers!

"I have an almost 2 year old spoo who is not interested in jumping in the pool. Our pool does not have a gate around it, however she is always supervised when she's outside. She fell in a few weeks ago and panicked. While we were able to coax her to the steps to get out, I really want her to get comfortable in the water so if she ever falls in she can easily get out. Any ideas on getting her to like being in the pool? Or at least tolerate it? I have tried getting in the pool and offering her treats or treating when she gets close to the water. I have also tried putting her on a leash and giving treats while I tried to get her to walk on the steps with me and no luck. She will get into the ocean to grab a ball, but no luck with the pool. If the ball gets in the pool she will lay by it until someone gets it for her. Anyone had any luck getting their dog in? ",dogs,[Help] Anyone know how to teach a dog to like the pool?
"Edit: shaved him\*\*

Pretty much the title. I have an almost 3 old border Collie (Milo) and I wanted to trim his fur so I went to a groomer, but they shaved him instead of trimming him. I am not sure whether it was my fault or theirs, but it doesn't really matter to me anymore because I just read about double coat shaving and everything I read did not look positive at all so I am freaking out a bit.

Is there anything I can do to help Milo's double coat grow back as best as possible? Fish oil capsules, special food, brushing, etc.?

"So, first time poster here, please forgive me if I’m in the wrong place! 

Recently I moved into a new house that my sister and her boyfriend bought, during the time that we’ve been here, we’ve noticed our next door neighbor leaves his pup outside all day and all night. He can’t be more than ten months old, and he’s a Husky/Shepherd mix. He’s big, he’s friendly, he’s one of the sweetest dogs I’ve ever met, and we live in the desert where 115 degree days are not uncommon. The owner of the dog from what I understand is a police officer as well. We’ve called some local shelters and even the city for advice, and considering he’s ‘doing the bare minimum’ he isn’t breaking any laws. In my area, said bare minimum consists of water and an area of shade, which is a non air conditioned dog house. The dog gets maybe twenty to thirty minutes of actual attention a day, but otherwise he’s left completely neglected on his own. If at all possible I would love to somehow get ahold of the dog, but at this point I just want a solution to help get him away from this guy who clearly doesn’t understand what he signed up for when getting a dog. Every time we head outside and he sees us, he bolts towards the chain link fence separating our properties, barking and whining, clearly desperate for attention from anyone at this point. We’re looking for any ideas or suggestions on this, we’ve tried talking to the man himself but our cries fell on deaf ears.

That lasted 2 days before I took him to the vet where he was prescribed a cough suppressant and doxycycline 200mg BID. I waited another two days before starting the abx. The cough suppressant worked but it wasn’t completely cleared. 2 days into the doxy he stopped coughing but became increasingly lethargic and started refusing food. He’s usually incredibly food oriented so this was far from normal. That was about 10 days ago and he still will only eat a very small amount of people food (he normally eats a high quality dog food).

"I want to sign my dog up for agility classes because I think she'd LOVE it. The only problem is all the classes I can find in my area are during the day, during the week, while I'm at work.

My dog is great friends with my best friend who she sees every single day already (we live next door to each other) and he is available during the day and would be willing to take her to classes for me.

I think it would be good for both of them, my dog for obvious reasons, and him because he's kind of a shut-in, so he'd get out more. My only hesitations are probably selfish. I'm jealous of the bonding they would inevitably share and I wonder if my dog would take any of that training home with her and let me do it too? Also would the trainer look at me like I have two heads if I explained she's MY dog, but my friend is going to be training her? It seems weird.

"\*\*Introduction\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* This will be my first dog, I have no experience training/owning dogs. I've interacted with friends dog's and dogs in the parks/streets and I'd say I'm pretty comfortable around them.

&amp;#x200B;

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?

&amp;#x200B;

\* If I can find a dog that suits me in a pound, I'm open to the idea of rescuing. If not, through a breeder is also an option 

&amp;#x200B;

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* A dog that that I can go running around with at parks, but is also comfortable being at a home with no backyard for \~8hrs on weekdays. A cute dog would be a huge bonus too! (My family would be more inclined to help take care of it haha). A low maintenance dog would be ideal (not too much shedding), i.e. one that only needs to be groomed once a week/once every 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Golden retriever/Aussie Shepherd/Border collies are ones I like to imagine running around with parks and stuff (theres quite a few dog-friendly parks in my area which sort of makes up for the my lack of a backyard). But smaller dogs like Pomeranians/Terriers also seem really cool!!

&amp;#x200B;

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Catch, roll over, play dead, simple stuff like that is fine! Doesn't have to be able to jump through hoops, don't need a show dog haha

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

\* 6 hrs (\~5hrs of passive interaction at home, \~1hr of active physical activity, e.g. walks, runs). Would do more active activity on weekends (runs/hikes)

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* About 1hr of active exercise a weekday (walks/runs) around parks and the block. Weekends \~2hrs a day, maybe hitting up a dog park every now and then

&amp;#x200B;

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd be happy to brush my dog once a week or maybe once every 2 weeks. Trimming hair and cleaning ears, maybe once a month (is that about average?) Wouldn't mind paying a dog groomer once a month or so.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Up to about 1-1.5 metres (40-60inches)

&amp;#x200B;

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Would be ok with a little bit of shedding, barking (not too loud to be a constant nuisance to neighbours and such) and slobber.

&amp;#x200B;

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd like to be able to let my dog off the leash every now and then (so probably wouldn't want any aggressive-type dogs)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Preferably a snuggly dog, or a little bit in between (but my family and I would want one that is happy to be picked up every now and then)

&amp;#x200B;

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

&amp;#x200B;

\* More eager to please, but not TOO hyper (ideally trainable enough to know when its ok to be hyper haha)

&amp;#x200B;

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

&amp;#x200B;

\* Maybe some barking too make any possible home intruders think twice, but friendly enough to treat familiar faces (friends and family) nicely!!

&amp;#x200B;

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'd prefer a dog that isn't aggressive to other dogs and people from the get-go.

&amp;#x200B;

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Ones that bark uncontrollably or in general, do anything uncontrollably 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lifestyle\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

&amp;#x200B;

\* The dog would be left at home when my family and I are out at Uni/Work (\~7-8hrs a day)

&amp;#x200B;

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Everyone in my family is fine with dogs, as long as they aren't too intrusive or too much of a nuisance (i.e. shedding/peeing on their bed, barking uncontrollably etc)

&amp;#x200B;

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

&amp;#x200B;

\* We currently have a guinea pig that is kept in a cage. But we would be able to keep it safely away from the dog if necessary. Not planning to get any other animals after getting a dog.

&amp;#x200B;

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Maybe at parks with random kids, and also younger family friends etc. (Everyone in my household is 18+)

&amp;#x200B;

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Not planning to rent

&amp;#x200B;

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.

""dogo Argentino; fila Brasileiro; Japanese tosa; American pit bull terrier (or pit bull terrier); and Perro de Presa Canario"" are required to be muzzled etc. Not looking to getting any of these aggressive-type dogs though anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello to all dog lovers out there. Sadly my first post isn't that fine at all - okay maybe a little ;)

The reason why I post here is my 17 years old dog. Overall he is a fit one with no larger problems, but a short time ago he wasn't as active as usual  - shortly after he began to smell differently and as I checked him I found a kind of 'parasite' - a lot actually. The image of the nose, is just the tip of the iceberg.

At first I thought he became a little incontinent and looses some feces at the balcony, but actually it was from the rubbing of his chin at the ground....

**Could someone tell me what these here are?** (sadly I can't upload a picture here at reddit?)

[dog\_parasites.jpg](https://postimg.cc/image/jbrvtf05j/)

After I treated him with baths and sound scrub downs with card soap, giving a tea spoon apple vinegar into his water (changing blood ph and smell a small amount, as this sometimes is for blood suckers a nogo and they will retreat) and cleaning his ears/body parts with a mixture made of equal amounts of appel vinegar, water and hydrogen peroxide 3%, these little beasts start to fall of and a lot have died already. But some always come back to ears and nose.

Ok at least he is now more active and starts to recover a little bit.

"So this is mostly a vent, but I'd love to hear opinions on how best to deal with this situation!


I recently started working at a dog daycare.  It's great to be able to share a common ground interest with my coworkers (because clearly anyone who works in the industry must love dogs/pets to some degree), but lately I've found myself biting my tongue more often to try and avoid drama.

Unsurprisingly, the two major topics that lead to the most controversy are training and breeding.


On the training side, one of my coworkers gives me a strong Cesar Milan vibe.  They talk a lot about dominance/submission, make that ""PSST"" noise, and have a tendency towards using intimidation on dogs.  It really gets under my skin, but the problem is that their methods do *work* so I get the impression that nothing I could say would make a difference.  I just try to ignore it as best I can.


On the other hand, the breeding drama only started recently.  We obviously get dogs in from all sources.  Purebreds, mixes, designer dogs - we still love on them all.  But then one of my coworkers essentially became a BYB (clean environment and registered with a tracked pedigree but any titles and health testing are several generations back).  This prompted several others to throw shade by discussing the horrors of puppy mills and hyping up the #adoptdontshop mantra.  


I'd love to take the opportunity to talk about the difference between responsible breeders, BYBs and puppy mills, but I feel like doing so would just make someone feel attacked.  Some are very involved with rescue organizations.  Others got their dogs from BYBs or pet stores.  But on the other hand, I feel like if I don't say anything at all, then that would just perpetuate the problem where this lack of education leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of the dog breeding world.


People are obviously very passionate about their dogs, so it's like navigating a minefield trying to be diplomatic!  In a way, it was easier to educate in a *non*-dog workplace because casual owners were not as deeply invested in their opinions.

"What do you do when an off leash dog runs up to yours?

I live in a bad neighborhood, which lately means a lot of dogs not being cared for properly. I have a small cavachon who is very friendly and always wants to meet new dogs, but if they sniff at her neck it’s like a trigger and she’ll growl or snap at them. With some dogs they’ll just back off after that, but I don’t know that ALL dogs will react like that. And if it’s a stray dog off leash, no ones there to pull them back if they attack. 

I know I need to try to train her out of that, but when she was really young she got attacked during a puppy class by another dog that pinned her on her back and went for her neck, so I think she’s just skittish about that area.

Basically, he excretes a small amount of anal fluid when he's excited (e.g. when he knows we're driving to the park or leaving on a hike).

It does go away temporarily after he's groomed, but it's a temporary fix. Every groomer we've been to has said there's not much to ""excrete"" when he's being groomed.

"So, I'm a dog person, my girlfriend is a rabbit person. We've got to learn how to merge our two biggest loves! Currently she has a rabbit and I have no dog, but I'm looking to get another in the next few years. I'm looking for a breed with a low prey drive who won't try to hurt the rabbit.

&amp;#x200B;

The rabbit has her own hutch and attached play area, but I'm hoping for a dog with a lower prey drive who won't be interested in trying to break into the hutch. (Even if the hutch is secure, rabbits are very sensitive creatures, and I don't want a dog that will bark at it all day and stress it out.) The rabbit hutch is in the living room, where we spend most of our down time (rabbits are very social like dogs and need a lot of time to bond with their humans, so I don't think moving the rabbit to a different, secured-off room is an option). 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering if anyone has advice on what kind of dog to look for, as well as tips on socializing. For example, would it make more sense to get a puppy so that I can socialize it with the rabbit from a young age? Or would it make sense to get an adult so I know its temperament?

Here's a summary of some of my desires for the dog:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Low prey drive, won't bark too much at the rabbit or try to hurt it.
2. Generally healthy breed or mutt--no brachycephalics.
3. Size is flexible. We have a two-story home with a very large yard. I'm picturing a small dog would be safer with the rabbit, but I love big dogs too. Medium exercise needs.
4. Age is flexible, but I do want a dog that's at least somewhat active and trainable, not an extremely low-energy senior dog.
5. Would prefer a dog that is friendly with all humans and animals. My last dog was a rescue and had severe dog aggression and fear reactivity toward humans due to a history of abuse. Loved her like crazy and worked with her for her whole life, but those traits were a big headache and difficult with my (social) lifestyle.

I'm open to shelter dogs and purebreds alike, but I'd love to hear if anyone has any tips. Thanks in advance!",dogs,[Breeds]Breed recommendations/general recommendations for a dog living with a rabbit?
" 

Farmer here. We adopted a dog that ""needed to be on a farm"" for her separation anxiety and want for exercise. Now, I'm not from this rural area, and I went in balls-to-the-walls with research on SA, expensive products, and a written-down strategy. We have an agility course, go on morning walks/bike rides down the dirt road, and practice obedience and nose games daily. We're trying to find her a job on the farm. Improvement is slow, but happening.

The neighbours are confused and on the regular tell me most people here would have shot the dog already. I'm ""making them look bad"" by walking my dog because their's just loaf on the porch, hang out on a chain, or chase cars all day. If we didn't plan things for her to do, my dog's life would consist of following us to a chore, then laying down while we work -- and we're busy.

Point being, the life of a farm dog in reality contains no more stimulation, therapy, exercise, or help than what the farm-people put into it. Surprisingly, dogs don't really go exploring too far on their own, they don't know they need to run around to feel good, and they won't find their own purpose unless put to work.",dogs,"[discussion] PSA: sending a dog to a farm doesn't magically solve separation anxiety, reactivity, or destructive boredom, BTW.

"Can someone educated enough in these two breeds too help me decide? Or maybe a different breed?

The reason I decided on these two is due to medical stuff (non-physical) a dog in my life is something that I've been wanting as a friend &amp; companion very badly. Im looking for a large dog that has a calm and friendly composure, can be independent and left for 4-8hrs if needed, sociable and can be brought in public (I realize this is heavily dependent on the dogs raising) , and can adapt to a small living space for a few months (not long term). It would not be my first experience with dogs, as i grew up with 4 of them and 2 are still alive (husky, golden retriever, black lab, poodle).  From what people have told me is that they are both very kind, gentle, and loving dogs that are not overly hyper and can adapt too apartment life pretty easily if needed(I have college for a semester) which is basically what im looking for. Also, as for large dogs their drooling is not as bad as a newfoundland per say, from what i've been told.  The upfront cost of the puppy is a non issue too me but, what breed is in general a healthier dog as im curious as too what to expect with vet bills and feeding?  I live in a cold area as well, can hit -30 without wind chill, so that is a factor, but not a huge one. Im not looking for a overly hyper dog either, but I do have the ability to give the dog 1-2 hours of activity a day and take it on day/weekend hikes or camping regularly. Shedding is not that huge of an issue too me either, but how bad do leonbergers shed? Is it very bad if combed/maintained almost daily? Any insight on either breed is very much appreciated. And if you think their are better dogs that would fit my situation I would love to hear your thoughts and if you think I should avoid these breeds altogether then please fill me in on why! Thanks!",dogs,"[Breeds] Help me choose between Rottweiler or Leonberger, other breed maybe?"
"I have an Australian Shepherd. He’s a little over 3 months. Since I’ve had him, he’s probably spent a total of 6 hours alone. At night he goes in his crate and doesn’t wake me up to go to the bathroom anymore, hasn’t had an accident in weeks. Every time both my girlfriend and I work we just take him to our parents. I’m probably going to move away next year. Should I get him more used to being alone in his crate during the day? Say I go to the store, I’ll crate him. Usually he goes with me everywhere. I’m just scared when I do leave him alone next year when he’s older, he’s totally going to freak out. ",dogs,[help] is this okay to do with my puppy?
"Yea.... this bothers me a lot lately. I have indescribable desire to get one more dog.. The thing is, I love my dog so much, and my dog loves me back. If I could make deal with universe to take away 30 years from my life and give it to my dog so we both live just as long id sign that contract no second thoughts.

The thing that botters me is that I think my first dog would hate me and be jelaous. My dog right now gets all the love and attention. The time I spend with dog playing right now wouldn't be halfed, food wouldnt be shared but doubled. But my dog probably wouldnt think about it this way. Im affraid my dog would be jelaous because there is suddenly another dog I'm taking care of, another dog I'm playing with.. another dog to share room with.

I prob sound little bit crazy here and many of u prob see this as exaggerating, but u know what, maybe ur not wrong... I just love my dog so much

Someone will prob be wonering, why do I even need 2 dogs..... I can't specifically answer that. I had desire to get one more dog for years now. I would actually like to get this idea of getting another dog out of my head but I can't.

"First time poster on this sub! If I made any mistakes with posting please let me know.

I have been searching for a way to get my Aussie Collie registered to be my emotional support animal (general anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder) for a little while now, and it seemed easy at first since there were several sites that offered “packages” that give your dog the certification as an emotional support animal.

...but I don’t know if it’s just me but the sites look a little sketchy, and I’m not sure that I can trust them. Is there any way to perhaps do it through the state or something? Are the sites that come up from a Google search legitimate? I am pretty clueless on the subject so any information would be greatly appreciated.

"I’m 16 now and live in a place where we aren’t allowed to have dogs but my therapist wrote me like a note/form saying it would help my mental health and it definitely has but there’s a problem. I’m leaving to college in two years and whenever I think about it without my dog I don’t want to go at all which sucks because I’ll be the first in my family to go and college has always been my dream. 

I don’t even have sleepovers anymore at other people’s house because I usually miss my dog and get anxiety. When I’m not in school I spend most of my time with him, whether it’s sleeping or taking him to the park, etc. I know everyone will say that it’s going to be too much of a responsibility but I take care of him now. 

I wake up and walk him to my school and then my mom picks him up and takes him home and I get home 5 hours later and then we go on a walk or to the park for 2 hours and at night I do another one hour walk. I know I won’t have this much time in college with all the homework but I’ll hire a dog walker or I’m willing to cut back on my social time with friends for him. 

I’m also nervous about leaving him with my parents because he’s a high energy dog and they probably won’t be able to take him out as much and give him the time he needs. I’m sure that he’ll do fine with an hour of exercise a day but I just get so nervous and sad when I think about the fact that he won’t be with me.

"Just a little bit about my situation, and I am curious how others have dealt with similar issues. 

We just had a new addition to our family, baby boy, and so things have been a little stressful for us and our 2 doggos. Last Sunday our 2 doggos were playing as they normally do. Well the baby started crying, we all got up to change the diaper. Come to find out my Jack Russell - Bischon mix, who turned 6 this year, was a little hunched over and shaking from pain. We Monitor her for a few hours, it seems to subside, we go to bed (never asleep with a new born) and she comes up and starts licking me all over the place, asking for help. So I take her to the emergency vet down the way.

This whole time she had been walking normally, just shaking. I thought we had gastrointestinal issues, or issues with her stealing a lock of oil from my blooming onion plate. We get to the emergency room, me in tears of course, and they take her back and diagnose her with a back issue, either a skipped disk or muscular pain. Oddly enough, she had this exact same issue last year when we got back from a week in Cancun. Almost to the day kinda odd. 

Anyways, they take her back again, and give her a shot of methadone for the pain. And send me home with some Rimadyl and Gabbapentine. As we are walking out her gait starts waiving, like her legs are numb. They said it was probably because of the shot, and should only last 6-8 hours. The affirmed that the shot was in the muscle around the tense part of her back. 

We get home, ""sleep"" fine. She was being a little rowdy, her legs still seem like they are giving her issues, like she cannot use them correctly. She will have spurts where she is completely fine for 5-6 steps then goes back to it. If she wants to take after something she seems to have full control over her back legs. She busted off once and I had to get some sedatives from our normal vet, so she can be more sedentary, which has worked great so the past 2 days. Not much movement but going out side. We are all a little bed ridden to even do anything active with the newborn. 

Anyways, to me this sounds like it could be an issue with a slipped disk as she has not gotten any better. Unless the methadone is still in her system? The vet said to give it a few weeks, but my heart is in pain watching her go through this. My anxiety is telling me it will be a $5k surgery, which we just cannot do: I want to, I want to so bad. But I don't know. I'm kinda freaking out because of the possibilities, and the numbness in her hindlegs seems to be about the same. 


Tldr; Jack Russell mix has back pain and minimal use of legs. I'm freaking out cause it's my baby girl. I don't have any idea what to do.

Has anyone else been through this before? What did you end up doing? Are there scenarios where you have to put down your friend? How well do wheel chairs work? How do you even go about paying a vet bill that large (if it comes to back surgery)?

I appreciate any responses in advance :)",dogs,"[Help] Doggo has back pain, not sure how to help her."
"Hey all! I'm hoping some of you might be able to help me. I have a two-year-old, 120lb, Mastiff, Standard Poodle cross named Love, that I love to death. She is very well behaved but loses her ability to focus on or hear anything else if she spots a car.

We live on an acreage just off a very seldom used dirt/gravel road. Love has been here since she was nine weeks old and has had free run of our yard until recently. Our road gets busier (as in maybe 5 or 6 cars go by a day opposed to 1 maybe 2 otherwise) during seeding and harvest. Especially during harvest we experience cars flying by our yard without slowing down or paying attention often above the speed limit (often 100kmph). We have a sign saying ”Slow, watch for dog” that we are putting up to try to get people to pay attention at least. 

Anyways, so what's going on is Love has taken to chasing cars. Not just chasing them but will lay low in the front yard, which makes her very hard to spot, waiting for a vehicle then when they are just about to pass her she runs directly in front of the truck/semi/car. At least if she was on the road to start with people might see her! The other night she pulled this move in the dark when I let her our for her last bathroom trip...I saw her in the cars headlights and thought for sure she would be hit. Miraculously she was not. The other issue though is she knows not to go near the road and until recently she never would, so when I'm hollering out the door trying to get her in when a car has passed or another one is coming she will slink out of the ditch and just walk on the road away from the house, which always reminds me of a kid deciding to run away when they’re in trouble, lol. 

Now since I realized this was a new habit and not a one-off thing, she is now on supervised, leash only outings. 

I don’t know where to start to correct this behaviour. She is such a good girl and listens extremely well with the exception of now when she spots a car. She comes reliably when called, will stop and lay down to wait if she's running amuck and I tell her to stop and in general is just very eager to please and quick to learn. I'm not sure if just working on her recall so that we get to a point she will always listen would work? The plan is to someday build a fence around part of the yard but I don't have the money for that and won't for a while. 

One thing I think I did wrong was freaking out a bit when yelling/calling her when I saw a vehicle approaching because the Mastiff in her makes her so sensitive, looking at her wrong hurts her feelings and causes her to pout.  So I think that's why she might not want to come in after the ordeal because she thinks she got yelled at? Other than that I'm looking for advice on what I can do to deter her from this behaviour...I love this dog a stupid amount and can't stand the thought of anything happening to her but I don't want to take away her ability to be outside when she wants to be :( Sorry for the long post, I am just hoping if you guys have enough information maybe you can help. Thanks for taking the time to read this. ",dogs,[Help] My mastiff/standard poodle girl has taken to chasing cars!
"Hi everyone!

I am meeting the dog that will likely become mine tomorrow. I am SO excited and SO nervous. I've waited for years to be in a position to adopt a dog. I've spent the last several months searching, going to shelters, watching rescue websites, to find the right dog. I've been picky, because it's extremely important to me to find a dog that will be a good fit for my lifestyle. 

I saw this dog on a local rescue's website last week and immediately thought she looked like a good fit. The right weight, a good breed mix, called ""laid-back"", doesn't need a ton of exercise, already crate trained, friendly, affectionate but not clingy. I applied for her and the rescue seems really excited about my application and me adopting her. I'm meeting her tomorrow and, if everything goes well, will bring her home Friday for a one week ""trial period"". 

I'm excited, but I'm nervous about how I will know whether she's the ""right"" dog for me. So for those that have adopted rescues, work at rescues, or just know dogs, I'd appreciate some thoughts or advice along these lines of my anxieties:

Should I expect to ""connect"" with her right away? I remember being younger and volunteering in shelters and finding dogs that I just fell in love with. I feel like I've lost that as I've become more realistic about the dog that's right for me. Should I be concerned if I don't feel that ""heart feeling"" toward her when I meet her? 

Similarly, we're meeting at a park and I'm concerned that there might be so much stimulus around that it will be difficult to get her to really interact with me to see what she's like. How do I handle this? Would it be crazy to still bring her home based on the rescue's description or is that a bad sign?

What questions should I ask when I meet her? I have a list that contains things like: generally, what is she like at home? How much does she talk (bark)? Does she do well left alone? How much exercise is she getting right now? Does she sleep through the night okay? (Obviously there will be changes when/if she comes home with me due to stress but it helps to know what she's like when settled). Etc etc but what essential things would you recommend asking? 

What if I do want to return her after the one week trial? I can't lie that I would probably feel terrible. Are dogs often returned during a trial adoption period or is it just something that's offered but frowned upon/judged if the dog is returned? I 100% won't return her if she's a good fit, but if she isn't, then I don't want to feel obligated to keep her out of the shame of returning her. 

Those are my main anxieties right now but I would appreciate any advice as I move forward with this. Personal stories are greatly appreciated!

"Introduction

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

So me and my wife have been debating on which dog we should get for a while. My schedule is 8 to 5 and her's is 10 to 6.

The issues we run into, is that I would prefer is midsize dog which is 20 to 40lbs and easy to train. Since we would be out during the day. We are okay with getting a dog walker during the mid day. We considered the American Eskimo dog since it gets good reviews with potential children and is friendly. But i read about issues with Separation Anxiety and excessive barking.

The Mini Aussie is another option but I am not sure how the dog would do in an 860 sq foot apt. In theory we both want a Golden Retriever personality that can fit in an apartment. Is there a dog that I am missing.",dogs,[BREED] Help picking a dog

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* This will be my first dog, I have no experience training/owning dogs. I've interacted with friends dog's and dogs in the parks/streets and I'd say I'm pretty comfortable around them.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]?

\* If I can find a dog that suits me in a pound, I'm open to the idea of rescuing. If not, through a breeder is also an option

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* A dog that that I can go running around with at parks, but is also comfortable being at a home with no backyard for \~8hrs on weekdays. A cute dog would be a huge bonus too! (My family would be more inclined to help take care of it haha). A low maintenance dog would be ideal (not too much shedding), i.e. one that only needs to be groomed once a week/once every 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Golden retriever/Aussie Shepherd/Border collies are ones I like to imagine running around with parks and stuff (theres quite a few dog-friendly parks in my area which sort of makes up for the my lack of a backyard). But smaller dogs like Pomeranians/Terriers also seem really cool!!

&amp;#x200B;

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  ",dogs,[Breeds] Looking to get a dog; first time owner from Australia
"I've been researching breeders (Australian Shepherd) for about a year and finally landed on one that I really liked and trusted. I've been on the waiting list for about 6 months and it is finally coming to the time where we'd like to bring a puppy home within the next 9 months.

Our breeder has two litters coming up, one born at the end of October to come home at the end of December, and another estimated next summer (born August, home October).

Our concerns are mostly around socialization and timing.

We play a lot of softball in the Spring/Summer (May to mid-September), so we would either like the dog to be socialized enough to be at the games or be able to socialize them at the games (loud, groups of 15-30 people, people running back and forth). I'm looking to cut down on this and just go to the games to watch my husband play.

I understand that puppy socialization is easiest in the summer months - lots of chances at parks with people jogging, biking, children's playgrounds... However the summer litters would mean a fall socialization instead, which isn't awful, since we have an active outdoor community here, so people are still out doing these activities in October. 

Another thing that factors into our timing is we're planning on having a baby sometime in early to mid-2021, which means a Summer 2019 puppy wouldn't quite be an adult yet (20ish months). Because of this, we're interested in the litter due in October. This would put the bring-home date at the end of December, with the socialization window on our end at January-February. 

While winters here don't get as bad as other parts of Canada, it still gets pretty snowy and blistery, keeping people inside. Even the hiking trails don't have that much foot traffic. What are your thoughts on socializing a puppy in the winter? The small list I have are:

* puppy socialization classes
* indoor mall
* stores that allow dogs like home depot
* banks
* gatherings with family and friends (and their dogs)
* bring into the office a couple of times
* skating rinks
* outdoor activities that draw crowds

I'm not sure if this socialization is enough, especially for a breed that is naturally reserved with strangers. In the summer, we'd be able to go to parks every day and visit different urban spaces, as our city is pretty tourist-y.

So while we think the earlier the better (so we can have a well-adjusted and fully trained dog before baby comes), we're worried about winter socialization - especially since the breed is naturally reserved and requires more socialization.

Another strike against this 2018 Fall litter is that we'll have just moved into our new home in mid-October, so by the time the puppy comes home, we'll have only been settled into our home for 2 months. I'm not sure this is enough time for our current dog to settle before bringing a new pup home?

What are your thoughts into which litter we should go with? Are there any other considerations we haven't thought of?

​

TL;DR: Which litter should I go with? Pro/Con list below

​

|2018 Fall|2019 Summer|
|:-|:-|
|**PRO**|**PRO**|
|Get a litter sooner - been wanting a new puppy for a couple of years and am really excited|Easier to socialize when it's warmer|
|Train the puppy through the spring/summer, when I have a lot more time|Will be better settled into our new home|
|Will be in adult-hood by the time baby comes|Litter parents have better temperaments|
|**CON**|**CON**|
|Might be too soon after moving into a new home|May still be a teenager when baby comes (20 months)|
|Winter socialization/potty training|Will have to wait 1 more year for puppy - our current dog is already 12 (but a smaller dog, so he's slowed down, but hopefully still has a few years left), would like to bring new dog before he gets too old.|
|Parents have more reserve than Summer parents (still friendly but may require more socialization)|Will be 9 months before parks and trails get busy again with joggers/runners/etc (but Fall socialization will be better than winter in terms of foot traffic and weather?)|

​",dogs,[HELP] Need advice on timing of a puppy
"Hi everyone, I'm looking for some help with my kelpie x heeler x who knows what. He's 1.5 years old, came from a shelter but we've had him since he was a pup. He's very friendly, and had never displayed aggression towards humans. He likes to be near us, and often sleeps on the couch or our bed at my feet/next to my legs. A few weeks ago, he was lying next to my legs on the couch and when I moved my legs, he growled. I didn't think much of it because he was asleep and I thought maybe I startled him or he had not realised it was me. However, this has become quite frequent now, and he will do it even when awake and seeing it is me who is moving. He also does the same to my husband. He is not unfriendly in any other way or in any other situation. He's also not moving to bite, he just growls.  


  
I'm not sure what has prompted this behaviour, the only thing I can think of is that my in-laws' dog growls very often at him (she hates him but for various reasons they need to co-exist in the same space quite often). I noticed that when they're in the car together and touch bums, she will growl at him and he will now growl back. That's the only thing I can think of that may have influenced him to learn this, but I don't know whether he could have generalised that behaviour to us moving our legs. But most importantly, how do I stop him from doing this? We're pretty quick to tell him off when he does this, but it doesn't seem to be helping.

",dogs,[Discussion] How to make the most of the time my girl has left
"I'm dog sitting at the moment and the dog I'm minding is a gentle labradoodle. He is wary of our cats and misses his cat brother.

I took him to the dog park near us and I wanted to do a lap of the park to meet the dogs before I let him off lead.

The meetings went well and he was fine with the other dogs and they with him. I stopped to start taking his harness off and the husky we'd met decided to attack him, ran at him from about 5m away to bite him. The German Shepard we'd met decided it wanted in as well after that. Luckily none of the bites made it through the skin though he lost a few big chunks of fur.

But the dogs were attacking for almost 30 seconds before their owners decided to even try to intervene. ""No"" and ""stop"" did nothing and both had to hold their dogs back, after I pushed them away a dozen times.

The worst part though was afterwards, they told me it was because my dog was at a disadvantage because he was on lead. 

1. They'd already met a few minutes ago with no problems, my dog clearly understood and responded to the idea that the lead meant no playing.

2. I should, without fail, let my dog off lead at the dog park or it's my fault if they get attacked.

3. The owner of the husky was telling me how she was a therapy dog and she would never do anything. And now that phrase is going to be triggering for me forever.

4. And of course, unharnessing your dog inside the dog park is a bad idea.

I've been dog walking for 5 years now and managed to never meet people with this attitude before. They seem to think that because they let their dogs sort themselves out off leash that they're perfect. And that because I'm dog sitting I don't know anything.

Edit: I've learned a lot today, about dog parks and about this subreddit. 

* This subreddit doesn't like the existence of off-lead dog parks that allow leashed dogs. And some users will actively blame leads for the aggressive behaviours of some dogs. I personally think this is a fundamental misunderstanding of dogs, and probably animals in general, and that if you support the idea that interactions between on-lead and off-lead dogs is by nature asking for a fight then you're being deliberately provocative to prove some sort of point that humans are superior or something. 

* Even if I was in the wrong and having a leashed dog is bad and I shouldn't have done it, anyone defending that the aggressive dog's owner shouldn't have more of the blame was downvoted. The dog that *literally* bit another dog should be *at most* equally blamed as the dog on a leash minding its own business. So keep that in mind... The people who vote here think that accepting blame for attacking someone is wrong and the victim should be blamed for provoking them.

* Implying that I knew what I was doing and had in fact gone through very similar scenarios before also garnered downvotes. So I guess my experiences are invalid and wrong. I should just stop pretending that anything I have experienced is meaningful and readily accept everything ever said to me as the gospel truth.

* Hyperbole will be misinterperted, which is honestly a good mistake for a dog training group so that's not so bad.

* Oh, and don't trust strangers' dogs at a dog park. They may be poorly trained and believe their dog's behaviour is dictated by other people's actions and therefore uncontrollable.",dogs,[discussion] She blames me for her dog attacking mine.
"[BREED] Best fit for 20's with 4 year old son.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
-No, I previously had a Treeing Walker Hound. He was stubborn and deaf while following his nose, but was a good dog and adept learner. He knew many commands, times of day for our routines, and actually decided to never bark following his 1st birthday.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?
-Breeder or pup from a rescue, so I can be there from day one.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.
Medium to Large in stature, calm and strong, but loving around family. This fits my personality and would also fit well with my wife and 4 year old son. Somewhat protective is a good trait but not necessary.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?
-I like the idea of a big dog, but I'm more concerned with my son's wellbeing and comfort. A medium dog breed like a poodle or lab seems like it'd he safer, but I'm selfish and need to hear common sense from a neutral party.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
-Intermediate commands and daily routines.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
-I work doing projects from home, so I would be able to devote most of the day to my son and a new dog.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  
- 45 minutes. I workout daily, and a running partner would be fine. The dog doesnt need to be a runner, though. My hound was a lazy dude 23.5 hours a day and I liked that quite a bit.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
-Daily brushing, I would pay for nails to be done, as that makes me uneasy. Cleaning ears is something I am comfy with, as in the humid south I had to keep an eye on my hound's ears.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?
-Big, but I know medium would be better for the family and would be happy with a companion over a size.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
-Shedding and slobber are fine, but I'd rather not have a long haired dog that requires constant vaccuming. Barking is unavoidable, but I'd prefer a dog that doesn't feel the need to bark all day. Or much at all, to be honest. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
-Not very. If my dog isnt in the yard I dont intend to have him off leash.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
-I like having my dog with me a lot, but I don't have to be in physical contact with it to be happy.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?
-Both, but I guess eager to please would be best for the family.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  
-Barking, going to the door, but not going wild.
With caution, but not disdain.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
Less aggressive the better. Have a 4 year old son, so a relaxed composure would be best.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?
-Besides constant barking, not really.

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
-Maybe an occassional night for 3 or 4 hours, but normally our dog goes where we go unless its to dinner. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 
-My wife loves all dogs over 10 pounds and is crazy devoted to any pet we would have. She would be heavily involved in spoiling more than training.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?
-No other pets.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
-My son(4 years old) everyday.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
-Rent in the future (wife is military, we move every couple years). Current lease says no pits.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
-None that I am aware of.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
-90 summer and 45 to 50 winter.

I have a nine week old Ridgeback. He is my first dog and the light of my life. He’s boisterous and healthy. Except when he poops he seems to have a hard time relaxing outside and I’ve started noticing a tiny bit of red blood in his poop. Now I thought it might be stress, it wasn’t a lot (literally the tiniest amount). 

This morning however he went and a few drops of just blood dripped out. Oh hell no. I instantly booked an appointment. His stool was also a little loose.

"I take my dog (1.5 year old lab) on a car ride to get coffee and go for a walk every morning.  He's always eager to go.  But when we get home now he won't get out of the car and acts stubborn coming in the house.  

He is extremely food motivated and now refuses my treat bribes.

The only way to get him to come in is to leave him in the car (door open) and wait for him to finally decide he doesn't want to be out there alone.

THIS IS REALLY ANNOYING.

I'm guessing it's because he doesn't want to go back in the house because I usually leave to do errands/work.  But I work from home in the mornings so I don't leave immediately.

Any tips?

I tried withholding his breakfast until after the morning walk so he looks forward to coming in to breakfast, but he threw up bile once because I'm assuming he was REALLY HUNGRY (he used to do this as a puppy if I woke up too late).

Any tips???

And it's not getting in and out of the car specifically.  He does that with glee any other time.",dogs,[Help] My dog won't get out of car/come in house in the morning

"So before you start writing out that it may not work for my dog or whatever, we've had great success with an underground wired dog fence. She has been trained with it from an early age and is well accustomed to it.

Our current underground wire system broke down, so I'm looking to replace it with a wireless one.

It's quite hard to find good info. Petsafe have some systems, but they use a basestation as the center of the safe zone, which I've read causes problems if you have a house with thick walls. I know Motorola have one, but it seems to work on the same principle as the Petsafe one.

What are some other options to consider? I'm surprised I'm not seeing more GPS based options. Thanks!",dogs,[Help] Recommendations for wireless dog fence?
"I’ve had a couple back and forth messages with a breeder. Things are going positively so far and I am preparing to call them soon to discuss things in more detail. 

This would be my first dog from a breeder rather than a rescue. My primary goal is to avoid offending the breeder while at the same time making sure I get the dog I want out of this transaction. I’m very worried that my inexperience in this realm will be apparent and I will say something that will cause the breeder to think I’m being cheap. Ask too soon and it will seem like money is the only thing I care about. We’ve all heard how expensive dogs are over the course of their lifetime and how a one time cost shouldn’t be the deciding factor. However, I need to know how much money to start setting aside and if I ask too late, I will have had a months long correspondence about a dog I can’t afford. I truly have no idea what to expect since I am looking at a rather rare breed.  As with most reputable breeders, this one doesn’t post cost and deposit details on their website or kennel Facebook page.

"After a long process, I finally rescued a dog over the weekend. Sophie is \~1 year old and the rescue listed her as a lab mix. Ultimately, I didn't care about her breed because I was focused on temperament. The trainer that I'm working with (my partner's dad) has been working with her for a few days and when he first saw her, he stated that her coat appeared like a lab but she doesn't have the build of a lab - he's raised and trained labs for \~20 years. As of yesterday, he believes that she looks like a short-haired border collie.

I know she's a mutt of some kind, but what breed do you see with you look at her? 5 pics included in the link below for reference.

[What Breed is Sophie?](https://imgur.com/a/Nfq8dda)",dogs,[Breeds] What breed is my new rescue pup?
"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*This will be my first dog and first pet ever. In college a room mate brought his yellow lab over for 2 weeks and I had the experience of playing with her and feeding her, but nothing beyond that.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* My ideal dog would be a medium to large breed, non-aggressive and not too difficult to control, good with children or smaller animals such as cats, and will welcome my company any time but isn't too dependent.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I'm not sure to be honest. I've always wanted a Husky but I could never own one due to my kind of lifestyle. I also admire Saint Bernards but I hear they aren't good for first time owners, and I won't be around all the time and I hear that they don't like to be alone so that will be a problem. My friend recommended me a mixed lab.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Maybe to bring something on command or just be able to understand simple things, like whenits ok to jump on the bed or when its time to go back into thier kennel

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* 2 hours max

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* medium to large.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* none of this is a problem except for barking. I don’t think I can handle excessive barking at night.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not very important. However, I’d like to be able to do this. My main concern is a dog that will run away or towards other people and not head my command if I tell them to stop, or a dog who may act aggressively towards other people or aniamls

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly, but would be preferable if they can stay comfortable alone for an extended period of time

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Wants to do its own thing

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Irrelevant to me. Won’t have too many visitors when I move out. However I’d rather my dog not act aggressively towards new people

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Other than aggression, no.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* I’ll be working 8am-5pm so this one might be a problem. Of course, maybe I could find a dog sitter.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* N/A

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* As of now, no. But I may end up getting a cat, but for now this is uncertain.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* N/A

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I am aware of the laws, I will be in MA.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Winter – -2 Summer – 56 f

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below. 

*  I'd also like to mention that this will not occur until I am financially stable. But even then, I'm not even sure if there is a dog that will be good for my lifestyle since I'll be working 8-5 on mondays through friday.

"so, a little bit of background. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ringo is a 3 yr old, neutered, St. Bernard rescued 2 and a half years ago from the streets. 

&amp;#x200B;

He has always been pretty docile with family members however he can get pretty aggressive with strangers. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 girls that work for us doing household chores. Ringo would bark at them once in a while but recently it's getting out of hand and he runs towards them barking and obviously the girls do get scared. 

&amp;#x200B;

However once he gets to them he either tried to grab their hands/arms with its mouth (i know it sounds like he is biting but he doesn't bite he pulls without harming the arm, he has done it with me to get my attention) or just sits and requests affection. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 90% sure he won't bite them ever. However due to its size having it run towards you its understandably nerve racking.

"[update] Aug 31st - I ended up taking my puppy to the vet yesterday, saw some change in behavior and the length of time I decided enough was enough. I brought a fecal sample along in case it would be helpful and they tested it. Got back to me today and told me she had contracted hook worm! Poor girl :( I did not see anything in her stool all week that indicated worms. Wednesday night, I noticed little white specks, so maybe they were there all along but not large enough for me to see? I don't know. Get her on the medication today and hopefully she will get better quickly!


[Original post]
Good day, I got a 6 month old puppy, for the past few days she has had the runs and soft stool. The first day she pooped up some painters tape pieces, nothing large and I know she didn't get the majority of what she was eating. Nothing since.

She has been going more then often, causing accidents in the house and her crate during the day.

At one point it did come out mucusy. However it was a couple poops over a morning.

I have been making sure she has access to water, she is eating her food and I have been putting some canned stuff in it as well to encourage her to eat. 

The past couple days she has been jumping around, playing with me and doing normal things, I feel she is a bit more sleepy then usual.

I am not seeing anything to worry about, I have called my vet a couple times and they say theirs nothing to worry about. 

This is the first time shes been sick and I'm not sure how long she will take to get better or what I can give her to help her get over it.

I have been recommended canned pumpkin, so I am going to get that and give it to her tonight after work and for dinner. 

She just had bloodwork done and there was nothing wrong with her (like the week prior to this). 

Any thoughts? Anything I can give her/do to calm her stomach and get her better?

"On a dog-related Facebook group, there was a recent discussion about one of our favorite topics in this here subreddit: ESAs. It all started off with someone posting that they wanted to ""register"" their puppy as an Emotional Support Animal (and would cost about $300 to do so) so that they ""would not have any problems with landlords"". Predictably, the conversation moved to discussing how irresponsible it is to abuse the ESA designation in this way.

The dog group in which this conversation took place is specific to Alberta. The original poster was from Alberta, and the other participants were all from Alberta. 

Alberta does not recognize any such thing as an ""Emotional Support Animal"". The only thing that is recognized in this province are [Service Dogs](https://www.alberta.ca/service-dog-information.aspx). There is no landlord and tenant law in Alberta that recognizes ESAs or grants any special access to animals that provide emotional support in any way that is analogous to the American Disabilities Act in the United States (though the landlord and tenant laws may differ in this respect in other provinces). Likewise, there is no Federal law that recognizes anything other than registered Service Dogs in Canada. 

The topic of ESAs comes up quite often here, I see, but it is important to understand that in many ways, the entire concept of ESAs as discussed here is very much limited to how they are recognized in the United States.

"We’re the owners of a 22 lbs Shiba Inu, who loves to travel by subway and train about twice a week. He’s small but dense. We originally purchased a backpack that’s similar to [this](https://www.amazon.com/PetAmi-Premium-Backpack-Ventilated-Designed/dp/B073XGDZ4S), until it started falling apart after 2 or 3 months. It was not well designed as it became painful to support the weight on my hips. In the meantime, our pup was outgrowing the backpack. This is when we noticed how rare it is to see owner-friendly designs for pet carriers. It seems most expensive / reputable pet carriers are always designed for the pet’s comforts, but none for the owner who carries the carrier.

The best backpack we have tried, however, is [K-9 sports sack](https://www.amazon.com/K9-Sport-Sack-Adjustable-Veterinarian/dp/B01N1OC7EB). Sadly it doesn’t match our local subway/train regulation for a pet carrier. 

Our current carrier is [SleepyPod Air](https://www.amazon.com/Sleepypod-Air-Cabin-Carrier-Black/dp/B002Z6005M) designed for carrying on a suitcase. It is a good quality product, except it’s not always possible to carry it on a suitcase... When that happens, there is only one single strap concentrating the entire weight on the owner’s shoulder. Eventually it started causing us back pain, though we minimize the amount of time that our pup needs to be in there for (i.e., taking elevator, escalator, or let him walk himself when possible). 

Earlier this week, we finally had it enough. After months of research, we’ve been hesitant about getting Kurgo’s new [G-train](https://www.amazon.com/Kurgo-G-Train-Backpack-Carrier-Adventurous/dp/B07CRS4FWW), the only carrier backpack we found so far that considers the owner’s needs more than the other options on the market. Kurgo products have been holding up OK for us, so we decided to take a chance. 

Forgive me if this post sounds like ranting. In the past few months, we’ve been researching so much on available carrier options. It has been exhausting. We even considered a stroller at one point, but gave up on it due to portability issues. Are we the only ones noticing how difficult it is for owners regarding pet carriers? Especially for dogs that are heavier than 10 lbs?

"**\*\*Introduction\*\***

​

**1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**

I had dogs growing up: an old English sheepdog rescue and a beagle-fox terrier mix rescue.

**2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/**[**http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**)?**

I'm open to either but have a slight preference for a reputable breeder, as I'm hoping to get a puppy that's been well-socialized during its first weeks.  This would be my first puppy.

**3) Describe your ideal dog.**

Friendly, easy to train, good recall, not high maintenance. Bonus points if they're mellow. I live in the suburbs with my husband and there's a mix of nature and city so our dog would come with us on neighborhood hikes as well as downtown walks. On weekdays we're homebodies (outside of a daily neighborhood walk or two), so we're looking for a dog that can also hang out with us on the couch. On weekends, we do more -- lots of nature, road trips, and social activity that our dog would be a part of.

**4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**

I'm leaning towards non-stubborn hypoallergenic breeds not because my husband or I are allergic, but because members of our extended family (who would visit) are. Our dog doesn't \*have\* to be hypoallergenic though. The dogs we're realistically interested are standard poodles, giant schnauzers (a bit concerned about these guys as I've heard they can be really protective and stubborn), and golden retrievers (I know they shed a ton). Honest disclosure: my husband isn't crazy about the standard poodle look (he's warming up to some of the short clipped poodles) -- it took me a while to warm up too.

If size/temperament/trainability weren't an issue, we'd lean towards dobermans, Bernese mountain dogs, Irish wolfhounds, samoyeds, Belgian tervuren, and Australian shepherds. I gravitate towards the herding and working breeds. Expectations/reality.

**5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**

Basic obedience and safety is important. It's important that my dog be house-trained, be able to be around kids and older people, and (friendly) dogs.

​

**\*\*Care Commitments\*\***

**6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**

Several hours a day, especially while they're a puppy. In the long-term, I will spend weekends, mornings, and evenings with them, at the very least. Either my husband or myself are often at home, so our dog wouldn't be bored frequently.

**7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**

45 minutes on the low end, 3 or 4 hours a day on the high end. Realistically I expect I'll average 1 1/2 hours each day: a quick morning walk and then a longer evening walk/exercise/play.

**8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**

I can brush their hair anywhere from every couple of days to every week and will need to learn how to properly trim hair and clean ears, which I'm happy to do. I can also pay a professional to groom them regularly.

​

**\*\*Personal Preferences\*\***

**9) What size dog are you looking for?**

Medium to large.

**10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**

Medium to low shedding is fine. Occasional barking is okay but we don't want a dog that barks nonstop.  Not into excessive slobber.

**11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**

It would be nice but it's not a top priority.

**\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\***

**12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**

Snuggly dog for sure.

**13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?**

Eager-to-please, with the understanding that they'd probably want to do their own thing sometimes too.

**14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**

I don't have a strong preference -- it could be anything from barking at strangers to warmly greeting visitors to running to notify me that someone is at the door.

**15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**

This makes me nervous. I want to say yes but am not sure I'd know how to manage a dog that's aggressive to other dogs. I'd really like to avoid this scenario.

**16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?**

Escape artist behavior and aggression towards dogs, neighborhood cats, children, people.

​

**\*\*Lifestyle\*\***

**17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**

We may leave the dog alone occasionally when we can't bring our dog, but they would never be alone longer than a few hours. I expect they'll home alone 2 to 3 times a week from 2 to 5 hours at a time. (Relatedly: I plan to crate train our dog for bedtime and alone time.)

**18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**

My husband prefers the fluffy breeds (he LOVES samoyeds and Bernese mountain dogs) but understands that realistically, these aren't the right breeds for us. This will be his first dog. He will exercise and take care of the dog with me.

**19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**

We don't have any other pets but our dog will spend time (a couple times a month) with my sister's Australian shepherd when we visit each other.

**20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**

No, although we may have children in the next couple of years.

**21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**

We own our home.

**22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?**

We live in the Bay Area, California and there are no laws banning certain breeds that I'm aware of.

**23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?**

High 80s to mid-90s in the summer and 50s to 60s in the winter.

"Hello all! Long time lurker of this sub - first time poster.

​

My wife and I got our Corgi Willow when she was 9 weeks old and have never been away from her for more than 2-3 day since. She was an incredible puppy, potty training was a breeze (only ever had 1 accident inside), she loved to kennel, and she followed commands flawlessly. She handled our other dogs well and even handled the addition of a puppy over a year ago, with no problems. She has always been a skittish dog from the moment we brought her own she was afraid of her own shadow. Let me be very clear in saying that me and my wife have NEVER physically punished Willow. She's gotten a stern ""NO"" when trying to pick something up that wasn't hers or steals one of the other dogs treats but she has never even gotten a nose tap. We truly have no idea where the skittish nature came from and chalked it up to her being from a not so great chain of pet stores.

​

Fast forward to 4 months ago when out of no where she started being disobedient. She turned 2 in March of 2017 and it started almost immediately after. She refuses to come out of her kennel to go outside - for no apparent reason. Weather doesn't matter, enticing with treats does nothing, even me getting on the floor in front of her kennel and calling her name does nothing. I have to physically pick her up and out of her kennel to go outside now. She even goes as far as to faking me out! She'll get out of her kennel and run towards the door - seemingly excited to go outside and then she'll turn the other way and go back into her kennel! She acts very timid when I go to take her out of her kennel but I am not asking for anything new here - she's been going outside fine for 2 years! Nothing in the environment has changed, nothing at all. Some days she will go outside just fine but not want to come in until I start to walk outside and then she runs towards the door.

​

I've seen on some Corgi group pages that terrible twos are a trend with this breed and they get some sort of complex at this age. Does anyone else have experience with this? Any idea how to break this habit she has? I have tried treats, different ways of enticing her out of the kennel, etc. I just feel like she is doing it just to do it with no real rhyme or reason.

​

Thank you!",dogs,[Help] Terrible Twos with a Pembroke Welsh Corgi
"Anyone else who owns a sighthound will probably get this, for anyone else: 

Greyhounds, Whippets, Borzoi, Saluki etc are all super thin dogs with arched backs, tucked in stomachs and long skinny legs. And for some reason, the majority of the general public believes that an obese dog is a healthy dog and that a perfectly healthy sighthound is starving. It's perfectly normal for their ribs to be visible, especially when they're breathing heavily during excersize. Yes, I'm aware he has knobby wrists and that you can see his hip bones. 

I can't take my Borzoi to the park without someone mentioning his weight. Some people go the passive, fake nice, beat-around-the-bush route: ""Oh, he's so skinny, is he a rescue?"" ""Oh, he's so thin, is he sick?"" Others prefer to throw slightly heavier shade: ""What does your vet think about his weight?"" ""He looks like he could use some food""

And then there's the dense ones who are always right and you can't convince them otherwise. The ones who whip out their food made of God knows what and just start feeding it to your dog without even telling you it's about to happen. The ones who blatantly announce that your dog is disgustingly thin and you should consider rehoming them if you can't care for them properly.

"Hello!  Last week I adopted the first dog I've had since I lost my last little buddy six years ago.  After getting over a mild case of the puppy blues, I'm in love.  My pup is 6 or 7 months old, and came from outside the country (Bosnia).  She's a mutt, but if I had to hazard a guess at breeds I can see some German shepherd and terrier in her.

​

Although her trip over here was stressful, she's adapting remarkably; she bonded with me in about five seconds, and with my housemate in about two hours.  We do have a cat, and their introduction went better than I could have asked for.  When I first brought the dog home, they both expressed interest in each other (curious body language) and even sat near each other (for which they were both rewarded with treats).​

​

As the week as gone by, I noticed the dog has begun to stare at the cat - I mean fixate.  I will call her name or nudge her and she still stares until the cat goes out of view.  Earlier today she even tried to go up and sniff the cat, who showed minimal signs of discomfort (allowed a sniff in her face) but jogged away when the dog tried to come around and sniff his butt.  I mention this because it doesn't seem that the dog wants to go after the cat - the dog also seems to be mildly afraid of the cat in fact.  If the cat's blocking the hallway, the dog stops and looks for another way around.  But still, something about how intensely she stares bothers me.  The only time they've gotten in a little quibble was when the cat tried to eat out of the dog's bowl once.  The dog barked, the cat scampered away.  The cat remains interested in the dog's food bowl and water bowl.

​​

I've read advice on introducing the pets, but they did so well (and because of how my place is set up, I have limited options for blocking them away from each other) that I didn't follow the introduction guidelines (aside from feeding them at the same time and in each others' presence).  I'm hoping I didn't set a bad precedent...but I guess my questions are: why does she stare so much?  Is there something I can do to break her concentration?  Do I have reason to worry?

​​

"Ok, so as i know and some of you know this has been a long debate in every puppy owner out there; how much is too much to leave your dog alone when he's a puppy?

Now, I have seen some people say crazy stuff ranging to leaving him alone all day, to not taking him out of your sight! Now both of these are the extremes, and i don't really agree with either of them. Now i agree a puppy can't be left alone for such a long time, and that he needs to be taken outside to relieve himself, but i personally believe that a two moth old puppy can make it on his own for one hour an a half if he's properly trained and exercised.

I personally don't believe in the 'you are a terrible human being if you leave your dog alone for one second, and should never have a dog if you do!' and trust me i'm not exaggerating i have seen, and heard people say that.    I personally used to leave my three month old puppy alone for three hours at most, and nothing terrible happened to him, and he seemed OK with it -i did exercise him a lot, and trained him before hand so he knows to be more independent. But, that doesn't mean i agree that you should leave your dog for the whole day at home, no matter how old he or she might be.

"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I moved out of my parents home and a state away to accept a full time job offer. I took my 8-year-old lab/golden mix with me because he's always been more attached to me, and wasn't getting the attention he needed at my parents home. He is much happier here with me and my boyfriend. There is almost always someone at home with him, as my partner and I work opposite schedules, and he goes on two nice, long walks a day, which he never had before as my parents would just let the dogs out in the yard.

&amp;#x200B;

He has lived with multiple dogs over the years. All golden retrievers, except for one Shih Tzu. He has never been aggressive, has never bit another dog or person in his entire life. He is a little skittish and has a bit of anxiety, but he is honestly the goofiest little love ball that I've ever met. He really, truly just wants everyone to be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem that I'm currently facing is his aggressiveness with other dogs when we're on walks. I am typically the one who takes him on his longer walks (one in the morning and one in the late afternoon/early evening) as I am the first one up and the only one home during those times. I find that when I walk him and we pass by other dogs or if he even sees another dog he will bark, and even try to lunge toward them. I've taken to crossing the street if I see another dog coming, but there have been a few surprise incidents where a dog came around the corner at my apartment complex, or someone walked out of their door with their dog and my dog just FREAKED out. Barking and trying to get closer to the dog. I do not believe he would bite, unless otherwise provoked or attacked, but I'm confused as he's gotten along with other dogs for so long and has never had an incident even with foreign dogs. Just the other weekend we took a trip back home to my parents house and my brother brought his 1 year old Australian Shepard and my dog didn't bark once at him.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any idea why he would be acting this way? My boyfriend says that he is less reactive to dogs when he walks him, and that maybe my dog is ""protecting"" me, so to speak? I didn't really think that labs/goldens would act that way, as they're usually friendly with just about anyone and anything. He has barked at dogs walking by my parents house before, but again, never in a truly malicious way or ""attack-like"" way. I'm just worried he'll never be able to get along with other dogs again, and that makes me sad as we would like to adopt another little one in the future.

"As my post states, my 2 year old golden retriever refuses and fights me when it’s time to go inside. 

We currently live in an apartment so every morning, afternoon and night I take my dog out for his scheduled bathroom trip. As of lately he’s fought me terribly after he’s finished his business about coming inside. Twice he’s slipped his collar and I ended up having to chase him around. 

I’m at the point where as soon as he finishes doing his doo he starts tugging to try and slip his collar. We’ve tightened up so he can no longer slip it and I’ve learned to not fight his pulling so that I don’t hurt or lose him. 

Has anyone had this issue before with their pups? I’m losing my mind at this point. I’ve been late to work in the morning and after lunch breaks multiple times due to this new issue.

"Hi r/dogs!

First time dog owner here. My dog ""Miffy"" is a \~4.5 month old Chihuahua mix. She is 3.6 pounds. She has been a really great puppy overall!

Today, when I came home, I noticed that Miffy was outside of her pen, but the pen door was closed. I knew something was up, because I ALWAYS keep Miffy in her pen when I can't supervise her. Maintenance was working outside my room, so I assumed that they heard Miffy inside and wanted to let her out. (I leave Miffy's pen inside my room, and my door was unlocked.) I leave again to get food, making sure that Miffy was inside her pen. This time, I lock my door. 

When I come back, Miffy is AGAIN outside her pen!

Later on, I manage to snatch a photo of [this](https://i.imgur.com/NIVC1Ra.jpg). Miffy is literally using her pen as a ladder to climb out! This time, she slipped and fell back inside :( She didn't seem hurt, thankfully.

This has never happened before. I think her climbing is ""triggered"" by wanting to greet people she hears/sees outside. In the climbing photo, she just saw my new roommates who moved in, and really wanted to greet them. 

In the previous incident, I think she wanted to greet the maintenance men that were working outside, so she climbed out of her pen. (Miffy is a social butterfly. She isn't much of a barker yet, but will whine for attention when I have friends over and she is put in her play pen. She is quiet when left alone, and doesn't seem to have separation anxiety.)

What should I do? I am worried that if she keeps climbing out, she could fall and hurt herself. 

Should I just get rid of the play pen completely, and let her free roam my room? She is fairly consistent with her potty training and doesn't seem too destructive. I would cover all cables with cord protectors, of course.

Should I crate her when I am away? Miffy is crate trained, but I don't want to crate her while I'm at work, because my work schedule is pretty unpredictable. (I'm a research assistant and some days I come home for lunch, while other days I come back late because I'm doing an experiment.)

Ideally, I'd like to make my current pen ""climb-proof,"" or find a pen that doesn't have rungs that Miffy can use to climb. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Regalo-192-Inch-Super-Wide-Adjustable/dp/B003VNKLIY/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535434158&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=baby+gate+long), but with narrower space between bars, so that Miffy can't fit through or get her head stuck in between the bars. 

Any thoughts/tips/suggestions? Thank you! :)

P.S. I am not 100% sure Miffy is a Chihuahua mix. That is just what the vet guessed, and we don't know what she is mixed with. Any guesses would be appreciated! :) We have gotten a lot of different guesses from people walking past us, including pomerianian, papillon, and even Australian shepherd!

" \*\*Introduction\*\* 

 1)	Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?  

\* My boyfriend and I have both grown up with dogs. I've had one or multiple dogs for at least 20 years out of the 26 that I've been alive. That said, though, up until recently I haven't had much to do with their training; my dad took charge of that. I do have a little experience though and I've been doing a lot of reading about pet ownership and training to get prepared. 

 2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( r/http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?  

\* We would love to rescue, but I think a reputable breeder my be our best option right now as this is our first dog outside of family pets and I would like to train the dog for possible service work (better explanation below).

 3)	Describe your ideal dog.  

\* Calm, cuddly, responds really well to training, more on the quiet side, active enough to join me walking around town but not so active that there's guilt for not being able to keep up with the dog's energy levels, good with other animals and children

 4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?  

\* I want a decent sized fluffy dog. Nothing huge, because we do live in an apartment, but medium to large. I think my preference is a Golden Retriever or Bernese Mountain Dog, although I do love pitbulls too. My boyfriend wants a Boxer eventually. We haven't quite agreed on a specific breed yet lol. 

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?  

\*(I apologize for how long this answer turned out) TL;DR---need a highly trainable dog to possibly help with life, or just at home. 

 Aside from regular house training and maybe a few tricks (my brother's dog knows how to turn the lights off and I think it's the coolest little trick lol), I would like to train the dog to assist me in my daily life. 

First, let me preface this by saying that I don't necessarily know for sure that I need a Service Dog, or if an ESA would suffice instead; I still need to have a discussion with my psychiatrist and therapist to really determine what kind of assistance they believe I need. But I have chronic pain issues, Bipolar II Disorder, ADHD, and severe anxiety (bordering on OCD but that's just what my boyfriend says; my therapist hasn't actually diagnosed it yet). It's hard to say whether I need a service dog, because when I'm good, I'm great. Out the door on time, handle work well, feed and bathe myself without any issues from pain or exhaustion. But when I'm bad, it's really bad. Meltdowns that last for much longer than they should until I tire myself out or my boyfriend can snap me back to reality. I often get so overwhelmed being outside of my house that I get trapped in my car in various parking lots (by trapped I mean that I sit there for an hour, usually longer than, dissociating and struggling to find the energy to either go into the store to get my groceries or drive home). I have a difficult time bending over from chronic back pain. It isn't impossible for me to do; but I would like a dog that I can train to retrieve items for me when I'm struggling to move. I struggle with a lot of paranoia and occasional hallucinations, so being able to train the dog to determine if there is someone actually there or just in my head would mean I could actually access the rest of my house when here alone. Self-injury, while infrequent as of the last year, used to be a big struggle for me and I would like to train the dog to steer me away from that and potentially go for help if necessary. I also struggle to remember to take my meds on time (I take them regularly, just not always at the time I should and it can really mess up my routine) and I've read that dogs have a great internal clock, so I'd love to have a dog that I can train to remind me when it's time to take my medicine. 

 \*\*Care Commitments\*\*    

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?  

\* I plan to take the dog with me as many places as possible. Training time will depend on what my doctors decide I need, but even if it will just be a pet, I plan to spend at least half an hour to an hour at the beginning working on training, and adjust that as time goes on to meet the needs of the pup.   
7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?    

\* I plan to take the dog on a walk every day, depending on what my body allows pain-wise. Goal is at least a half-hour walk, plus play time in the house and yard. If I can't do it or go as far as the dog needs, my boyfriend will step in to make sure it gets plenty of walks and exercise. We live next to a park, and there's a dog park not far from us that our friends go to and we plan to take the dog as well. 

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?  

\* Open to grooming at home and paying a professional for whatever we can't do. 

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*  

9)	What size dog are you looking for?  

\* Medium to large.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?  

\* Don't mind shedding, cannot handle slobber (sensory issues), and a few barks here and there are okay but we live in an apartment and I don't want a yappy dog that will bother the neighbors or us. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?  

\* I would like for it to be trained that well, but it's not a deal breaker. 

 \*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*  

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?  

\* Snuggly for sure!

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please? 

 \* Eager to please

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?   

 \* I want the dog to be chill with strangers, as there is a big yard in front of our building that someone is always walking through or groups of kids are playing in, so I don't want it freaking out constantly due to that. My parent's dog will bark once or twice if she sees someone coming up to the door, and then runs to the window to watch, so I'd prefer to have one that responds like that. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs? 

 \* We plan to get another dog in the future, so I would rather it not be aggressive.  

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?  

\* It can happen to any dog, but I would really prefer a breed that isn't prone to separation anxiety. Also, slobber is a huge no no (which sucks because some of the biggest slobberers are also the cutest!)

 \*\*Lifestyle\*\*  

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone? 

 \*Not often, my boyfriend and I work opposing shifts at the same company, so when I'm coming home, he's waking up to leave and vice versa. I plan to take the dog with me as many places as I am able, but I can see it being alone for a couple hours several times a week. If my boyfriend comes to the day shift in the future, it will be alone for up to 8ish hours a day, but I plan to come home on my lunch or hire a dogwalker if that happens. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?   

\* Our roommate prefers cats but she likes dogs too. She will feed/let it out if we aren't home for some reason. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?  

\* Roommate will likely be bringing a kitten home before we bring home a dog.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?  

\* Semi-regularly? The neighbors downstairs have kiddos and I have several neices and nephews that will occasionally be around the dog.  

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?  

\*We currently live in a good size apartment, and there are no breed or weight restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?  

\* I live in Louisville, KY. As far as I know, there aren't any banned breeds.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?  

\* Average summer day is in the mid 80's, muggy and hot. Average winter day is anywhere between 20's to mid 40's, depending on what kind of winter we're having. 

\*\*Additional Information and Questions\*\*  

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.  

\*My boyfriend also has mental health issues (severe depression), so there is the potential for us to end up in depressive episodes at the same time and for physical activity to greatly decline during that time, so it would probably be best to have a more laid back dog that can adapt to activity, rather than an active dog that will have to adapt to being more laid back.

"Hey hoomans of reddit!

My SO and I have adopted a family of mixed labs (a mother about 2 years old and her two pups guessing 6-7 months old).
The first 10 days or so went well. They eat and drink, are playful, and they enjoy running around in the backyard and so on. They know where to pee and they hardly bark. 
However until a few days ago, the pups has been fighting a lot between themselves. Not playing but actual fighting. We don’t if this is based on an incident or they’re jealous, or whatever, they’re fighting and it’s getting worse by the day. We and their mother has been breaking up their fights, however today it got out of hand: their mother ran away scared and both pups now have bleeding cuts.
I’ve now for the first time separated them into different rooms so they can calm down while were checking for other injuries. 

But should I do now? What are we doing wrong as dog owners? What could be the possible problem of this? Jealousy?

"Hi /r/dogs!

Long time reader. First time poster.

My dog Samson is a ~3.5yo pit mix that I’ve had for ~2.5 years. I have zero information on his first year of life, the shelter couldn’t even tell me if he was taken in as a surrender or a stray. I helped him gain weight and socialized him for the first time when I got him.

For practically this whole time we’ve lived in Dallas, which is a relatively new city with a lot of sprawl. We still lived in an urban area but the streets are wide and the traffic is not all that dense.

This month we moved to Pittsburgh and for a solid month he was adjusting so much more quickly than I expected. I noticed pretty much immediately that he didn’t like walking on the busier roads and that seemed reasonable so after trying a couple of times we avoided them. I live in the heart of the city but we do have an actual neighborhood with purely residential streets, so it was fine.

My street, however, is on a pretty steep incline. So cars have to accelerate. If traffic was really flowing on our street I’d take him a different way and walk him through a nearby retirement community, which he loved.

Today, however, he just refused to leave our little parking area. I tried a few times throughout the day, making sure he was relaxed and calm beforehand, with no luck. Just now we went out because he has not pooped today and a motorcycle turned down the driveway while I was trying to coax him into an alleyway (still had his harness) and he ran, full-force, away from me.

That has NEVER happened before, even with how high his anxiety was when I first rescued him. And I have absolutely no idea what changed, because this past month he has actually seemed eager to explore his new environment. I have proven capable of helping him with anxiety in the past but I’ve never witnessed anything like this in him before and feel completely out of my element.

Has anyone experienced anything similar and/or have any advice to offer?",dogs,[Discussion] Just moved from TX to PA. Dog I’ve had for years is showing intense new anxiety to cars passing by and I don’t know where to begin.
"Hello all!

I recently had a very trying experience visiting family with my dog. After cutting the grass, my father sprayed weed killer without telling me. Of course, my dog has gotten used to doing his business and playing outside in ""clean"" grass, so the reaction to the weed killer was pretty bad. Red, itchy paws that scabbed over were the biggest problems. After a lot of paw soaks, allergy medicine, coconut oil and staying off the lawn for about a week, the paws are mostly under control. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem now is that I'm seeing a brown-red stain at his nail beds which I have read is an indicator of a yeast infection that could have been brought on by his reaction to the weed killer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still rinsing paws after he goes outside and doing paw soaks, but I'm not sure how I can tell that he is getting better? Will the redness disappear or do I need to wait for it to grow out? What else can I do outside of cider vinegar soaks or diluted boric acid soaks?

Again, I've been doing these things, but don't know how to know if he's getting better or if I'll need to get help from the vet.

I'll be going soon in about a week before air travel, but always like to put my best foot (or paw) forward when seeing them.",dogs,[Help] How to tell if my dog's yeast infection is improving
"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have raised and owned two dogs prior, first a Vizsla then a Border Terrier. I have taken care of a Labrador mix, &amp; a Boston Terrier. I have fostered a Jack Russell. I am planning to do extensive research on whatever breed I happen to decide on. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* I would prefer to buy a dog from a reputable breeder.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* I would want a dog that is medium sized (around 40-65 pounds). A versatile &amp; trainable breed would be preferable as I plan to compete with them in herding trials, agility, dock diving, &amp; obedience ( I also love teaching new tricks!) when they are old enough. I would want a breed that enjoys being around me and is affectionate.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Out of the research I've done, Border Collies (working line) &amp; Australian Cattle Dogs seem like they would be good fits as far as things go (temperament, exercise, etc). I am open to other suggestions as well. 

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* As I mentioned in my answer above, I would want to train my go in agility, obedience, herding trials, &amp; dock diving. I also would much enjoy teaching my dog fun tricks. Running beside my bike when full grown would be nice, but not necessary. 

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Usually I can spend about 7-8 hours daily with my dog. This includes training, playing, exercise, &amp; just being around me in general.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* I am planning to give my dog 35-45 minutes of physical exercise, and around 30-35 minutes of mental stimulation each day.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I am very much open to cleaning ears and brushing fur. I am not very open however to dogs that need their hair cut / trimmed (e.g; poodles).

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium sized breeds are my preference (around 40-60 pounds).

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* I can handle all three as long as it's the right dog.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* It would definitely be nice to do, but it isn't something necessary.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* I would love a snuggly dog. I would definitely want a breeds that is affectionate.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Definitely an eager to please breed. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I don't mind if the dog is reserved and cautious with strangers, as long as it isn't out right aggressive (e.g: snapping, snarling)

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* It wouldn't be preferable, but I'm fine with it as I have dealt with others that were dog-agressive.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* Extreme agression, incredibly stubborn (I'm okay with the dog having a slight stubborn streak but I want a trainable &amp; eager-to-please dog )

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 4-5 hours daily. As I said before, I plan to get a dog walker when it is a puppy.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* I live alone.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Nope.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* I rent. My current apartment is a 2 bedroom, and the only breed restrictions are on pit bull types.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in Toronto, Canada. Pit-bull types are banned, as I said in my above answer. These include the APBT &amp; AmStaff. If your have a dog that looks like a pit-bull (e.g American Bulldog), you have to have papers to prove that it isn't a pit bull.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Toronto has pretty much seasonal weather (it can get extremely  cold during the winter)

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* No additional information.

"Hello!

I have a 6-month-old blue heeler named Mila. She's been a very sweet addition to the family, and is mostly a behaved pup.

I do have one big issue with her, however.

Mila was once trained to stay in my large bathroom while everyone (myself and roommates) were out of the house. This helped her get in potty training habits, etc. She had a crate that was her designated sleep space, and she relaxed in it with the gate open quite often.

When she grew a little more, we started to let her free roam for short periods of time in the house. During those short times though, she would get into all sorts of trouble rummaging through trash, chewing objects, and getting poop from the catbox.

We tried to go back to leaving her in the bathroom again until we can trust her to not destroy the house, but she chewed up the dry wall and barks relentlessly.

My roommates need to sleep, and her barking is way too loud to keep her in my bathroom where all the rooms are anymore. We also don't want more damage to the walls.

So she is now in her crate in the basement bathroom, where her barking is at least quieter.

Problem is, she freaks out as soon as she is in her crate now. This isn't separation anxiety, and boredom is more likely, but she flips out right after I or anyone else, put her in her crate.

We take her for runs at least twice a day. I run her right before putting her in her crate, to the point where she doesn't want to walk she's so tired. I give her a few minutes to go potty and drink water, then put her in her crate with a Kong full of peanut butter (special treat when she's in the crate only). The bathroom fan is on for background noise, and low lights to make it more relaxing in the bathroom.

All of this, and she still flips out. She always covers herself in drool and can't catch her breath. She doesn't even glance at her treat (we've tried others too). As soon as she's let out, she goes potty and practically passes out from exhaustion.

I don't know what else I can be doing. I want to free roam her some more, but I can't trust her to be left alone more than an hour in the house. She's so sneaky and food driven, and my roommates dont want things destroyed in the house anymore.

If there's any suggestions, please let me know! Right now all I can think to do is give her something to make her drowsy just so she can calm down.

"Hey reddit! I got a situation on my hands and could use some advice. I have an opportunity to adopt Basil, a 1 year old golden retriever. She is owned by my ex boyfriend and he has been overwhelmed by taking care of her and is planning on rehoming her. He is also moving to a home where he can’t have a dog. Our relationship ended a couple weeks ago (it was mutual, we are both sad but no hard feelings) and he is very willing to give her to me. I love this dog and she loves me. My ex boyfriend always has said that I’m her favorite person, even over him. I was very much involved in picking her out and raising her. I’ve been involved in training her and feel like I have realistic expectations as to her needs. However, there are a couple things that make this complicated:

1. I’m currently living with my parents and taking care of my dad who is dying from colon cancer. He will likely pass away in the next couple months. My parents have an older 13 lb poodle who initially got along with Basil, but got scared when Basil was more enthusiastic than he was comfortable with. I suspect they would get along over time, both dogs have adjusted well to changes in the past. It will likely add some strain to have a young dog in the house, but my family is supportive of me if I choose to adopt her.

2. My actual house that I will move back to when my dad passes away is pretty small. I live with a roommate and a cat. the yard is not fenced in, but my plan is to have her on a long line and to take her to a big park that’s next door. I live next to a nice walking trail and lots of green outdoor space. When I return to work I’ll be away for about 9 hours a day, but my roommate will be around some of that time. I’ll be able to spend 1+ hours in active time with her during the week, much more on weekends and lots of hangout time. My friends and roommate adore her, and everyone is supportive of me having her. I also live in walking distance to a brewery and coffee shop that have outdoor seating where we can hang at together.

3. Basil hates riding in cars. This has improved significantly over time. She was was bred by an Amish family that I don’t think exposed her to cars. I know that if I bring her to my parents house she will likely have to get in a car several times a week (to a dog park and maybe to doggie day care on busy/difficult days) and I’m nervous I’ll make it worse. Ex bf is working on getting anti anxiety meds from the vet.

If I decide to do this, I’ll get her in a week. My plan would be to introduce her to my parents dog in a neutral setting and keep both of them well exercised and socialized with dogs their own size. If I’m able to I’d like to take her to an obedience class, though she already knows sit, stay, touch, down, and I’ve been working on leave it. I have two coworkers who can take her for 1-2 weeks each if things get difficult.

I think she will be a wonderful help in a horrible time. Having a dog who loves me and will get me outdoors and exercising every day will be great for me. However, I’m really nervous that I won’t be good enough for her, that she’ll add stress to a difficult time, and her needs won’t be met, resulting in behavior problems. I’ve been looking for a dog to adopt for the last year or so, but always chicken out before committing. It’s a huge responsibility and I want to do it well. Maybe the smart thing is to make sure she goes to a family with kids (she adores children). I don’t want her to feel abandoned though, I want her to feel loved. I just don’t know what the right thing is right now.

What should I do? Any suggestions for making this transition easier. ",dogs,[discussion] Should I adopt my ex boyfriend’s dog?
"Hi all,

Last week my boyfriend and I took in a 1yo-ish mutt &amp; we know essentially nothing about her past, but she came to us partially trained. She is housebroken, sleeps perfectly in a crate, knows how to sit &amp; heel (never tugs on the leash) and is eager to please to a fault. She is happiest following us from room to room and (mostly) sitting nicely for us.

I know part of this is her needing to settle and let her personality come out, but we bought some random cheap toys to see what would tickle her fancy and she seems to like chewing on softer things (tennis ball and tug rope) but as a late evening chill-play type activity. If we try to active-play with her to get her to burn some energy, the only thing that seems to get her going is running alongside us or chasing us around a tennis court. Any attempt to introduce a toy to the equation gets either totally ignored or confused looks.

This results in her not burning much energy on her own and I think that contributes to her occasional bursts of barking or jumping at us - she's too dependent on us for attention and energy burning. I'm also going to start ""capturing the calm"" exercises but I'd like to find a way to get her to play (either on her own or with us) in another way than just running back and forth.

She gets probably a collective 1.5-2 hours of walking a day. We have a fenced yard but she doesn't like to be out there without us. (this is getting better over time)

Any tips?

"Hi guys! So I feel like this is a dumb question and I'm missing something obvious...so be patient. ha!  


I've seen many posts that discuss exercising different dogs, and one thing I've seen repeated is something like, ""Well, you've been taking them on 3 hour walks every day and they're conditioned for that... it's not enough anymore."" That makes sense to me...with humans, repeating the same workout over and over makes that workout easier and doesn't leave you as worn out as it did when you started.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a 6-month-old puppy who is SO SO chill. He was extremely malnourished when found - he weighed just 10lbs and is now up to 17lbs with just a bit left to gain. I think part of that ""chillness"" is because he just didn't have the energy to do much. He'd have 30 seconds of puppy energy and then just lay down and fall asleep. He's a LOT healthier now and I've seen his energy levels increase accordingly, but he's still SUPER chill and prefers to spend more time cuddling us than running around.   


However, I love to take walks and would love to take him on long walks. He's certainly not ready for them now - we take him on about 20 minute walks now and that about exhausts him.  But when he's ready, I want to be able to build him up to longer walks.  My concern is that if I do that, he'll develop a NEED for those longer walks and lose his ""chill""/calmness. I took our old dog on 30-60 min walks 2x a day and did tons of training and brain work with him. But he became a terror if he didn't get both of those walks, and he needed longer and longer walks and more and more mental stimulation. Is there a way to have a happy  medium where the dog is okay going on longer walks (i.e. won't overtire them or hurt them physically) but doesn't NEED those walks?

"A bit of a long story. My 13 year old goldendoodle has in the past 24 hours developed an egg sized lump on his neck under his chin. It is not bleeding, though it is red. I called my vet and and a veterinarian emergency line to ask if immediate attention was needed, but they both said if he is eating and drinking and playing as usual (which he is) then it's fine to wait until the vet has an appointment.

"Zoey was an English bulldog, almost 8 years old.

She was used abused and used only for breeding until 6 years old when she could no longer breed. She was tossed out the door and found herself in the middle of nowhere.

Someone found Zoey and brought her home. They posted on Facebook saying she needs a loving home. That’s where I found her. 

I had a shepherd/husky/mix who was only a year old. I could not say no to helping at least foster Zoey until she found a home.

She was overweight and in distress, her stomach was dragging on the floor, she was dirty and would not stop heaving for air and whining.

I brought her to the vet, she was healthy. Just overweight and she had just given her last litter. Also was in distress her pups were taken from her, just like they had been all her life. 

Zoey calmed down and started to enjoy her new life. She loved food and napping! She was a lazy dog but as soon as you got near the leash she went crazy , she loved adventures.

She turned into a queen, she was a character. Napping, making funny noises, would get random bursts of energy, she was doing what she wanted.
I’ve never seen a dog with so much character. 

During our 2 years together she loved to cuddle and loved humans. Didn’t care about other dogs but LOVED humans. She would cuddle with me constantly, by my feet when I’m on the computer, by my bed when I’m sleeping and by the door when I left home. 

I left her with my parents while I went on a road trip. It was the best vacation I’ve ever had. My mother called the night before I came home and and said zoeys breathing is very loud. Not uncommon for bulldogs at all - I said I would check her out when I got home the next day.

The next day my mom said she was looking really well! I had a long drive home and to make it short - she fell asleep and never woke up. She died 3 hours before I got home. Her heart gave out. She was running around, napping, feeling fine then all of a sudden went kaput. She started to decay fast so my mom brought her to the vet before I got home.

I’m happy she passed peacefully and got to live the end of her life happily. It happened almost perfectly, I’m just really sad I didn’t get to see her one last time. Coming home from a trip excited to see her, oh the surprise. 

I live alone in a house with her and my husky (husky likes to be alone). Life has been different. There is nobody by my bed when I sleep anymore. There is nobody by my feet when I’m on the computer. There’s nobody cuddling me when I’m on the couch.

"Hello all! In August of 2015 I adopted a 7 year old mini aussie named Kassie. She was the sweetest dog pretty much ever (which is a lot for me to say because my family's goldendoddle set a really high bar). She had been abused and really did not trust anyone but me and maybe my roommate a little. Unfortunately I was visiting home and out volunteering with my mom watching her when she got scared and bolted to the door. And extra unfortunately my parents have never gotten around to fixing our screen door so it did not latch and she escaped. I came home as soon as I could but we never found her and animal control came to my house late at night with her. She had been hit by a car and did not make it. It devastated me and when I got my next dog I vowed I would do everything in my power to not let that happen again.

My husband and I now have 2 dogs. And one of the tricks I have taught to try and prevent this was ""cross"" which is when we are crossing streets. Both of them know that the ONLY time they are allowed to cross the street is when I say it, even if I walk into the street and say ""come"". We just recently had to ""use"" this trick for the first time though (After about 2 years of teaching it to them). We were staying with my parents and my mom was going to go get the mail. Normally telling them ""stay"" and then going through the door is enough, but this time they saw dogs in the neighbors yard across the street and rushed out. Neither of them crossed the street though. They stopped about 5ft from the edge and just excitedly barked. There were no cars coming but it was nice to know they would actually remember the command when we weren't there to enforce it.

This wouldn't have saved Kassie because she would have done about anything to get away from people she didn't trust and I can't blame her for that.

"Hi guys,
 I have a 3 year old Maltese I’ve had with me since he was 6 months old. He’s grown to become a very quiet, cuddly spoiled dog with tiny bursts of energy. He’s not into tug of war kinda play, or fetch etc. He just likes to chill.

Recently though he has started developing a habit of resource guarding and it’s gotten very bad. He started by RG ONLY furry keychains or toys, and was fixated on a furry bunny keychain I had attached to my purse. Every night he would sit next to my purse and not let me near the bunny. Eventually I gave it to him, he ran under the bed and slept next to it. I was not allowed near. A few days after he forgot about the bunny and doesn’t care about it any more. 

Then this grew into guarding anything. He started suddenly guarding his “hump bear”, and sleeps next to the bear every night, and won’t let me near them. He also guards raw hide bone. Sometimes he brings the bone on my bed and then won’t let me near the bed. He growls a LOT. He once snapped at me for getting too close to him and hump bear. I leave him alone, but anyway I never ever tried to snatch anything from him. We don’t play those games. He can have what he wants and no one ever steals it. 

Tonight I found him on my bed with a bone next to him. He started growling as I came near, but I kept telling him to go away because it was my side of the bed he was on. He eventually moved, and when I sat in bed he cuddled up next to me. Then I wanted to place my hand on him as I always do, and he snapped at me and bit me. He didn’t tear any skin or anything, it just hurts. He’s been scolded and told he’s a bad dog, tied to the bed, and I’ve taken away all the bones and hump bear.

​

Our dog Tucker was super malnourished and neglected when he was discovered. He weighed about 10lbs and you could see and feel every single bone (in fact, he very nearly died from hookworm). In just the weeks since he's been in foster care (about 3 weeks) and with us (about 3 weeks) he's gotten up to about 17lbs, with 3 pounds of that happening in 1.5 weeks after all of his worms and coccidia were completely vanquished.  I think he's VERY close to being a good weight and he has an appointment next week to verify this with the vet. He has a thin layer of padding over his ribs and his bones aren't visible anymore, but you can still feel them.

We've been feeding him Royal Canin gastro puppy food at the advice of the vet because he had quite a bit of diarrhea. When that starts running low (which will probably be this week, actually) I'll start mixing in Kirkland Nature's Domain puppy food.  He gets 2 3/4 cups of the Royal Canin every day, split between three meals. We don't free feed.

​

So here's the REALLY stupid question. Once he reaches his ideal weight - will his body just stop gaining weight at that rapid pace? He's a puppy, so he still does need to gain as he grows, but how do I stop the very rapid gain and prevent him from getting overweight?  Our previous puppy gained about a pound a week about from birth until he hit about 26lbs at 8 months, and then the growing slowed significantly, and I expect Tucker will be fairly similar.  Do I need to do anything to make sure he's gaining just the appropriate amount of weight or will his body naturally regulate his size?",dogs,[Help] Taking a dog from underweight to normal weight...without becoming overweight?
"Didn't realize this was gonna be long so I'll leave this up top-

(way) TLDR; my slightly overweight 11 yr old dog has been breathing heavily, not eating, on and off lethargic. Doctor is unconcerned every time we bring it up, saying she's just old or hot. Concerned, but don't want to visit the vet again for something the vet doesn't see as an issue.

​

​

I have an 11 year old ACD/German Shepherd mix that I'm a little worried about. It's the family dog but I've been away from home for a few years so I haven't been extremely present in her life recently. Both my parents are very disabled so she hasn't been getting that much exercise lately since I'm gone. She's overweight, nothing that the vet is super concerned with. She has always been super active and energetic in the past.

​

I've just moved back home so I've been trying to exercise her as much as possible but I'm not sure how much she can do because she's old and has been breathing weird.

For a while we've noticed her breathing really heavily, even when inside with the air conditioner and when she hasn't been playing or outside. Especially at night.

​

We've brought this up to the vet almost every time we go, which is fairly frequently. They just say she's just hot, or she's old, but they are never concerned when we bring it up. I'm not sure if it's just a weight issue or something more that they're not investigating? But it just seems so not normal.

​

She's also pretty weird with food. She usually is excited when dinner time comes, although she doesn't always finish everything. But some days she just doesn't eat. Even when we know she must be hungry.

​

Also, a little over a year ago she had emergency surgery for a ruptured benign tumor on her spleen. She recovered pretty well from it. Unsure if that's related to any issues she may be having now.

​

​

That's an issue she's having today. Didn't eat yesterday or today, been very lethargic and seemingly sad, breathing heavily, can't jump up on the bed (which she usually can do, even though she requires a running start these days). She was home alone with my mom for a while before this but she says she was with her the whole time and didn't get in to anything.

​

​

I want to take her to the vet, but it just seems like we ALWAYS take her with these concerned and they never think anything of it. We just can't afford to keep pressing these issues that the vet isn't concerned with even though they really freak us out. We just haven't been getting and different opinions so it seems like a waste to try and investigate further, ya know?

Is she really just that old? Is it just because of her weight? I've seen much more overweight dogs that seem not to struggle as much. I dunno. And since she's older I'm scared to overwork her since she already breathes so heavily when resting.

"On 4th of July I rescued a small dog off the streets after I saw her almost hit by a car. Couldn't find an owner in the community near by so I took her home. Took her to the vet, she was healthy but no chip. We tried to find the owner but no such luck. I'm kind of a sap so we ended up keeping her! I already have a cat and my boyfriend has a dog. That cat and dog aren't friends by any means but they leave each other alone and can be near each other without problem - they are used to each other by now. The new dog, however, is OBSESSED with the cat. Endless barking and chasing. She shakes and stares at the cat any time she sees him. Over time, we've got her to bark less (she's a bit of a yip yap dog), but she still can't leave him alone. The cat is annoyed but doesn't do anything except the occasional swipe when the dog is literally on top of him and he feels threatened. He has no ill will towards the new dog, just wants to be left alone by him. I miss my cat! He is always in hiding and when I try to give him attention, the new dog will jump and whine and endlessly try to get at the cat. I think she's concerned for my safety, I don't know. I just want to be able to cuddle with my cat sometimes. I'm new to owning a dog, I don't know anything about training. My boyfriend doesn't really know much about training either, he just raised his dog since she was a premie so she listens to him and has a great personality in general (just jumps a lot which my boyfriend doesn't care about). Can anybody help me figure out how to bring some more harmony into this house with all the animals?

​

If this is helpful: The cat is a male, 5 years old, Abyssinian mix, great personality (almost like a dog, very affectionate and gives kisses), but he hides most of the time now (he's normally very social). Only is aggressive with the dog when he feels threatened but doesn't really attempt to hurt her, just defends himself.

My boyfriends dog is about 5, some sort of terrier breed (I'm not great at knowing breeds), also a great personality, but joins in with the chasing with the other dog to get in on the fun. Normally leaves the cat alone. She's really smart. She can open bags, even (I didn't know this until after she got into a backpack and found some chocolate....). Like I said earlier, my boyfriend doesn't really know much or care much about training.. I think she would respond well to it though (I'm annoyed at the jumping when my daughter who is 4 comes home from school because the dog always jumps on her and is big enough for it to be a bit of a problem)

The new dog is a very small dog, about 8 pounds and white short soft hair. Maybe some sort of terrier/poodle/Chihuahua mix? I honestly have no idea. She's about 2 or so (the vet's guess). She's a very cute sweet dog, it's just the barking (which is better now, she used to non stop bark at him) and the obsession with the cat that's the problem. No matter how many times I take her away, push her away, try to separate them, she is relentless. She's kind of dumb, doesn't really learn. She is a cute though. My daughter loves her, and the dog puts up with her trying to carry her around all the time (my daughter keeps getting in trouble for this because I'm afraid she'll her the small dog on accident but the dog is very sweet with her and just lets it happen)

They are all neutered/spayed.

"Just wanted to post a bit of ""Monday motivation""! I have to admit I held off on making a happy post in case it was a fluke... 

For context, he's a 55 pound 1 year old Australian Shepherd so... he has virtually no impulse control and a bigger stubborn streak than I do, which until I met him I did not believe exists. You have to believe I was at my wit's end with him many times! 

There were many walks we came back from when I was so frustrated I felt like crying. I am a 120 pound woman and he has a high prey drive. My neighborhood is full of rabbits and squirrels so his ""choke myself while sprinting full-speed for a block and a half"" routine was... rough. For a while I thought I might as well schedule a shoulder surgery now because I didn't think that joint was ever going to be the same after owning him. 

The first time he walked with the leash loose was the beginning of last month. We were walking and I was a bit distracted and do you know how I realized he wasn't pulling the leash? I genuinely thought he slipped his collar and made a break for it. I had been walking for half a block without looking at him because I was exhausted and out of it, and then I just got hit with this intense fear that I lost him because I couldn't feel pressure on the leash. I stopped dead and glanced down and then the fool just stood there looking up at me with these big eyes like ""Why did we stop?"" and so I apologized to him and kept walking, a bit stunned. 

And naturally kept my eye on him the rest of the way. I literally cried happy tears when he just trotted next to me for the whole four blocks home. I was convinced it wasn't real, but now at the end of August I can say that, while he does have bad days, almost every walk we go on is a good walk! He is so smart and leashes were his only bad manners but they were so bad it was almost a deal-breaker, so I am immensely grateful he apparently learned/respects me enough to behave.

I have no idea what to tell anyone struggling with this, because one day he was an absolute terror and the next day he was perfect and has been consistently good since, just like a switch flipped. But I just wanted to say there is hope :) don't give up on your heavy pullers! I had to buy a leash with an extra handle for mine and lose a bit of sanity every day but he is nailing it now! We do occasionally still struggle with squirrels but considering I've only been working with him since April I am ecstatic and now very hopeful that by the time he's a full adult he will be normal. (He's an Aussie though so... it'll stay interesting I'm sure).

PS. I have no idea how to include video or anything on Reddit but here is a link to a gif of the first time he walked properly :) I had to capture it because I was certain I was hallucinating. https://gph.is/2BQL6rZ

"One of the dogs at my work became tangled in a lead and screamed because he was panicking. Another dog immediately lunged at him to attack him and my boss said the above when I asked why he’d do that. I have plenty of experience with dogs and usually when something like that happens the other dogs will crowd anxiously around it and whine. I’ve never seen one attack. However, my boss has much more experience than I do and I trust his expertise so I’d never just write it off; instead I thought I’d ask here. Is this really a thing? If it matters, the attacking dog was a lab and tends to be very anxious but not usually aggressive.

"Hello all!

I have been dying to get a dog for years after growing up with several family dogs throughout my life I finally feel I might be able to get a dog now that I am done with college, had a full time job for a few years and now buying a house! I have pasted the questionnaire below.

The TLDR; version is that:

* I am moving into a new 2 story house with my wife and her little dog (12lb Chihuahua/Terrier type mix).
* I want a dog more suited to me that is medium-large and family friendly who likes to play but will be ok left alone at the house most of the weekday while we are at work with just the other dog for company.
* Most dogs I am interested in dont seem to be great left alone but I'm not sure how much the other dog will help. A few that I like are : Golden Retreiver, Golden Doodle, German Shepard, Belgian Tervuren, Finnish Lapphund, Husky (and its smaller versions) but open to several other breeds to make things work.

See below for all the details.

**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* No, I have had several family dogs throughout my life of different sizes. This will be my first as a primary owner though

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* Rescue is better but I will prioritize the right type of dog for me over where it comes from

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Friendly, affectionate, likes to play some when I am home, doesn't require too much exercise, and is content with staying at home with just another dog during the day as my wife and I work full time.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Golden Retreiver, Goldendoodle, Chow Chow, greyhound. Open to suggestions but I would prefer a friendly medium-large sized dog. LOVE Huskies but I dont think I can leave them alone during the day. Maybe a Pomski or Klee-Kai would be ok being left alone with another dog though.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Basics - potty training, sit, shake, lay down, roll over, fetch, leash training.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Probably an hour of real exercise in the afternoon on a job or bike ride and some more general playing in the house on weekdays.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* 1 hour per weekday and multiple on weekends. Plan to visit the multiple dog parks nearby as well.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Open to either. The less the better but I could take a few minutes each day or longer grooming weekly.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium-large

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* The less the better but I can handle it all.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not much. It would be nice to walk to the mailbox without a leash but I can't imagine many times this would be helpful.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly is great but if more personal space means they're more ok being left at home during the workday with just another dog I am happy with that too.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Either. I am getting a dog to spend time with it but would be happy if it didn't need me for 100% of everything

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Barking with a stranger knocking or entering my yard but greet anyone who enters my home while I am around politely.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I cannot because we will have another smaller dog

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* anything that will tear up the house while I am away or attack our smaller dog

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Most weekdays it will be left alone with only another smaller dog from 8-5.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Wife and I care for her smaller dog but we both would like a medium-large dog for him to be friends with and that I can play fetch with

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

"His leg was amputated due to a bad break that eventually led to an infection under the splint along with loss of circulation. He had been taking antibiotics prior to the amputation due to the discovery of an abscess near the edge of his splint by the armpit.  The surgery took place on Friday, we picked him up Saturday.  He continues on the same antibiotics. The vet told us he should have minimal to no drainage and we were given instructions about monitoring the incision 2x a day, with one of the symptoms to monitor being “watch for drainage.” Well, later that night after picking him up, he started to have lots of drainage with a foul odor. We took him back first thing in the morning, and they told us there was a hole near some necrotic tissue that needs to continue draining. In other words, our job was just to prevent a scab from forming, let the wound continue to drain, and continue his meds as ordered. Anyway, wiping away the drainage is a nightmare. It’s excruciatingly painful for him, and he literally drips everywhere in his kennel. His whole kennel smells like an infection, and keeping it clean is nearly impossible due to the constant dripping of stinky drainage. Today, during a routine attempt at cleaning the hole (with chlorhexidine solution given to us at the vet), I noticed it had gotten bigger and the drainage has not reduced at all. I’m very concerned about this. Does anyone know if this draining hole is “ok” like they make it seem to be at the vet? It is not near the incision like a dehiscence, it’s a random hole in the center of his tissue. They are making it seem as though his antibiotics will do the trick, but I’m not seeing progress. We’re taking him back tomorrow, but I’m afraid we will get instructed the same thing, and we aren’t provided very good rationales by the nurses and techs and it makes me feel uneasy. I just can’t believe he’s supposed to have an open draining hole that makes a huge stinky mess, and all we can do is try and wipe it regularly while avoiding getting our hands bitten?

Same deal when I'm peeing. It's so funny I burst out laughing every time and she startles away from the door.

I just recently adopted a 4 month old catahoula. He is a good dog at home and is very loving and smart. However when I take him for a walk or to the dog park he constantly grows and barks when he sees other dogs. I took him to meet my girlfriends dog who is very dog friendly and he was growling barking and even snapped once but he eventually became cool with him. Another time I was walking him and a stranger tried to let my mom meet his after I was talking to him and my dog snapped once again. He was even growling and barking at a 9 week old puppy. I'm just wondering if he could trained to stop this habit or if it's just his instinct and if it will just get worse cause that is what I have read about catahoulas. This is an important issue cause I live in a apartment complex with many other dogs around us.

"I have an 11yr old large breed mix that  has started sleeping so soundly I have honestly thought he was dead at times. Once he's asleep it can be really hard to wake him up, I can lift his leg and gently drop it and he doesn't even twitch. Some times he feels cold to the touch, not his fur, his body. He's eating, drinking and eliminating like normal otherwise.

His blood work is good and other than some spondylosis and Canine Cognitive Dysfunction, he's generally health. He did have a seizure after his Lepto shot this year and has times were he ""spaces "" that our vet thinks MIGHT be absence seizures, but she isn't too concerned. His is on Gabapentin and antihistamines.

"Hey y'all, looking for a little guidance w/r/t my boy Buster. I'm aware the only way to get a conclusive answer is to see the vet, but I thought it could be helpful to start here so I can maybe figure out if I need to see the vet, like, yesterday-- or if it's a 'wait and see' kind of a deal. Fwiw I'm a new dog owner and I've only had my lil buddy since June so I'm still learning. 

Buster is a 12yo chihuahua mix rescue, neutered, cute as heck. In early July I noticed him scooting and chewing on his bum-- I figured his anal glands needed expressed, the vet confirmed that and expressed them, and he seemed back to normal after that. About 3 weeks ago I noticed him scooting and biting again. I noticed rice-looking stuff in his stool, realized he had tapeworms, gave him tapeworm meds, and the segments stopped appearing. However-- he's still been scooting and biting and his tummy has been looking bloated on and off. This led me to believe he might have other types of worms, so last Wednesday I gave him an OTC broad spectrum dewormer (Bayer Quad Chewable Dewormer, if it matters).

He seems a bit more comfortable, his stomach has been less bloated, and he's eating again-- but he's still biting and chewing at himself and yesterday I noticed hair in his stool. He doesn't appear to have any of the symptoms of bloat other than, ya know, the bloat itself so I don't THINK it's that. But I also know it's a very serious illness so maybe I should have him checked out ASAP? Is there a chance his body is still processing the dewormer and flushing out the worms? Is biting/chewing ever a side effect of that? Is it possible his anal glands could be full AGAIN, just 5ish weeks after they were expressed by the vet?

Basically: how worried do I need to be?

[edit: his diet is Taste of the Wild dry food with a small amount Taste of the Wild wet food mixed in. He gets 2 meals a day. He always has fresh water available. It's possible I do sometimes overindulge with treats... but I don't *think* his diet would be a contributing factor to his anal glands filling up so quickly]",dogs,[help] worms? deworming side effects? anal glands? or something else altogether....?
"I'm in the process of trying to crate train my dogs (Puppy is 15 weeks at a guess, the older dog is 1yr,9mths) 

The issue is that my puppy keeps weeing in her crate. I have placed blankets over the crates, and beds inside, both crates are the right size for the dogs and I feed all of their meals and treats in the crate. 

 I am still in the process of trying to housetrain the puppy. She still isn't asking to go out so I try to preempt her going to the loo by taking her out regularly. 

This morning I let them out for the loo, fed them their breakfast, loo again. Then I put clean bedding in the crate (since the Puppy had wee'd on them) and she went into her crate and wee'd in there... it hadn't even been an hour since she was last let out and she hadn't asked at all to go out and I didn't catch her sniffing as she usually does when she's thinking about going. 

I picked up the bedding and have soaked it in enzyme cleaner (as I did the last time)...I took them out for the loo before heading out, and when I got back 2 hours later there were no slip ups... I checked the crate and there was a wee on the bedding....

I just don't know how to make it so she won't want to pee in her crate. I spray enzyme cleaner on anything she pees on so I don't feel like it smells of wee. She is a rescue and stank of urine when we got her so I have a feeling she wad used to peeing in her cage and sleeping in it - is crate training still viable? What can I do to address this issue? 

Thanks!

"(Not a native speaker, sorry in advance)

I'm going through a hard time right now and I need some help and guidance.

So, my 13 y/o dog (Lab/Samoyed mix) has been through many things the last couple of months. She started coughing a few months ago, what we first thought to be kennel cough. After she had been coughing for two months, we took her to the vet. He listened to her heart and lungs and didn't find anything out of the ordinary. She continued with the coughing, so we took her again and took a blood test, which showed signs of inflammation. And so, in the last few weeks she's been on antibiotics.

Another problem she's been having is a decline in her appetite. It started a few weeks ago, when she didn't seem interested in her food. We though she didn't like her food anymore and we bought her wet food, so she could eat something until we can buy her new dry food. She loved it, however, she wasn't very interested in the new dry food as well. She would still eat sometimes, even though she would skip a few meals here and there.

In the last two week, her appetite has decreased drastically. Furthermore, she has been vomiting and having diarrhea. The vet suspected a virus, and he gave her injections against vomiting and diarrhea, and gave us pills against it as well. We have been giving her a few of these pills (Most of the times we couldn't because she's struggling like hell), and the antibiotics simultaneously.

In the last few days, however, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. She stopped vomiting for the most, but she hasn't eaten since Thursday, and she doesn't even want her wet food anymore. In the last few days we offered her bread and salami which she usually loves, but she's not willing to eat anything but pastrami. She didn't go for a walk for days - we tried to take her but she's reluctant to move. This morning we found her covered in her own urine. We stopped giving her either of the pills because it doesn't seem like she can go through anything anymore.

The vet gave us pills that should increase appetite, but she's struggling so hard and we can't make her take one. He and my dad believe that it's the end, and to be honest, I'm not so optimistic as well.

She's still listening to us, greets us, moves around a bit and eats pastrami when I offer her. However, she's barely eaten anything since Thursday, almost everything she does is sleeping, she's breathing deeply and panting. She's always been a chubby dog, and now she's lost so much weight that I can feel her bones.

I don't know if that's what we should do, if those are the signs that she's suffering and should be put down, if it's a mistake, if there's something more we can do. But in the same time she's been through so much already, and if those are in fact her finale days, I don't want her to suffer any more. And if the vet thinks that her lack of appetite is a sign she should be put down, I'd think that he knows what he's talking about.

I'm confused and scared, and I'm so sad. It seems impossible to even think about it, but if she's in pain it must be done. So please, I'd love to hear your guys' input. I just need some guidance, to clear things up, and maybe a little emotional support, because I can't imagine my life without her.

"To start off with, I hope this isn't annoying to post. I have done quite a bit of reading online (have hit up all the main color genetics sites) and did a cursory search on this subreddit before posting.

I have a husky thing (very high %) that has a very unusual color pattern, and I haven't really been able to figure out what exactly is going on with her coloring and markings. I know from coat color genetics websites that \[[huskies and many northern breeds in general have some strange characteristics](http://www.doggenetics.co.uk/albino.html#husky)\], and that terminology a/o the actual genes that cause certain visual results can vary breed by breed.

My dog is what I would describe as ""cream"" or ""fawn"" colored, with urajiro (?) markings and a dark saddle. She's very similar to the Saddleback dogs \[[at this link](https://www.huskycolors.com/rescue.html)\] — darker than the white dog but not as saturated as the reddish dog.

Anyway, what makes her unusual is that she's also a merle. The merle pattern is restricted to the saddle area, and when I saw a photo of her for the first time, I thought it was blue merle. Similar to a Dunker, for example. But upon meeting her in person, I realized that the ""grey"" areas of what seemed to be blue merle are actually just black tipped hairs blending with her cream colored undercoat.

I know that there are many different ""colors"" of merle, like blue, red, sable, etc etc. But I'm not really sure what hers would be called. At one point I thought sable merle, but was told that she's a ""black and tan"" dog, and that's mutually exclusive with sable. Would she potentially fall under the umbrella of agouti merle?

"I adopted my dog about two months ago. He’s a year and a half old mix. 

We started crate training about a week after adopting him. He took to it pretty quickly, sprinting in when he heard me open the treat bag. As of the last week, he’s started refusing to go in his crate. I think he knows that it means we’re leaving. He used to cry a bit when he’d first go in but then settle down. Now he won’t go near it. He won’t take a treat from me if I’m sitting by it. 

Crating while we’re out of the house is important since he eats fabric and trash when left alone. He also has accidents when left out of the crate. 

I don’t want to force him into the crate since that won’t help the situation, but leaving him out isn’t an option since it’s unsafe for him. ",dogs,[Help] Crate training regression

"Hello dog lovers

I have been lurking around this page for a while and have seen lots of interesting thoughts and ideas, so I thought the community might be able to help me.

I currently look after dogs in my spare time. It's not a career type deal but I love the companionship of the animals and as I can't work at the moment it's been really great for me and the pups too!

I have a regular customer who's 4 year old German Shepherd loves to come and stay with me and I absolutely adore having her. However the owner has never, and refuses to vaccinate her saying that it's pointless because she rarely comes in contact with other dogs and she doesn't need them anyway as she's no longer a puppy. As far as I can tell, she's a happy, healthy, energetic dog and although I have mentioned it, it's not really my place to tell the owner how to take care of her pet - she is not abused and seems to be well looked after. 

I suppose my question really is how damaging is it to the dog having not ever been vaccinated? My dogs have always been vaccinated as puppies and had boosters every three years or so. I don't know if this is something I should bring up with the owner again or not? I'm so attached to this dog and I really want what is best for her.
