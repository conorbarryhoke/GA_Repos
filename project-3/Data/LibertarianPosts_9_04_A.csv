"Of course the Democratic party can go right next to them in the deepest, darkest pit of Tartarus, but at LEAST the Democrats support drug decriminalization, immigration reform, prison reform, law enforcement reform, civil liberties (sometimes), etc. 

I used to prefer the GOP but the notion that they're ""fiscally responsible"" goes straight in the trash whenever they get the majority. We're already going over 1 trillion more in debt because of Trump, Ryan, and McConnell. 

It seems like the GOP is just the Democratic party but with a little more hatred for human rights.

About a week ago I had a conversation with my family about whether burning the American flag should be legal as symbolic speech.  I understand that because of because of Texas vs. Johnson (1989) and US vs Eichman (1990) it's currently legal.  However I'm still interested in the idea of it.  I personally would probably never burn a flag but I still think it's important that symbolic speech be protected.  Most of my family was against me in that it should be protected speech (except my younger brother who is a self described libertarian).  I'm curious what this sub thinks on the matter and I'm open to having my opinion changed.,Libertarian,Legality of burning the American flag as symbolic speech.

"Hi everyone, first time poster here. I see that there’s a lot of Trump hate here regarding his trade policies. I agree with the sentiment that tariffs aren’t good, I also see them as a means to an end. Their purpose, according to the administration, is to force China to change its behavior. If this were actually true, and these tariffs were temporary, would anyone here change their minds regarding them? I say this because I approach libertarianism like all other things, too much of it is not necessarily a good thing. Talking to China hasn’t appeared to change their mind and these tariffs have apparently gotten their attention. 

I also extend this line of thinking to immigration. I believe that as time goes on, the world, especially North America, will become more integrated, which is good. But at this moment in time, I can’t support the free movement of people from poverty stricken South American countries into the US. I say this as a Hispanic who has fled the failed socialist policies of Puerto Rico.

Yes I think semi automatic restrictions should be repealed (aside from age and keeping some lax background requirements). 

However I can’t imagine why automatic weapons should be fully accessible from the viewpoint of safety for society. Most responses I hear usually frame it that government by default has no right to restrict auto weapons. However is there a real net gain in community safety by legalizing Fully auto weapons, and maybe even any requirements or background checks?

TL;DR - Would it really make a community safer to fully legalize fully auto guns w/o background checks?

36 wrongdoings of the United States political system and the American culture.

1. An unequal legal system for men in favor of women. Gender should not play a role in punishment, and yet in the US courts punish men in general with much worst sentences.
2. A legal system meant to punish rather than rehabilitate. If we wish to have a lowered prison population and less crime we must reduce the stigma of criminal history, as well as reduce punishment in favor of rehabilitation.
3. Divorce courts favoring women over men. In regards to divorce court, when both mother and father are able to properly care for the children women and men should have equal access to the kids. As well as the disillusionment of alimony.
4. Corruption rampant within the political system. US politicians have become far too little concerned with standing for the people and have become more worried about selfish matters. Such as job security in which they spend a majority of their time looking for endorsements and, donations for their reelection.
5. Extreme bureaucratic inefficiency. The US government no longer cares about spending wisely and now wastes money on void projects with no end product simply to have people working.
6. Major political parties not representing the people.  They have no attended to the care of the younger generations as they do not see their concerns as viable.
7. Major political parties dominating the political sphere. Both Republicans and Democrats have made the marketplace of ideas amongst politics an impossibly. You must either be Republican or Democrat to play the game. This is one of the major things we were warned of by those who created our nation.
8. Acceptance of radical ideology. There is a global trend of accepting violence or discrimination among any race or other skin deep matters. This needs to be erased in both the far right and far left.
9. Lack of unity among ethnic and cultural groups. For the history of the United States the people were always united in the fact that they are American. This trend is leaving and thus we see our own countrymen as enemies.
10. Public school and universities teaching dogmatic ideology rather than free thought. Schooling by dogma is only a trait of the profoundly irrational and intolerably ignorant. Whether based in political ideology or religious. We must fight that in our schooling systems.
11. Reelection focused presidency. A leader's goals ought not be out of selfish ambition but out of want to do right by the people.
12. Major violations of the citizens right to privacy. Our fourth amendment is all but non-existent with the patriot act as well as numerous other violations of public privacy.
13. Interventionist foreign policy for non-major allies. The United States has no cause to defend other nations except for those who have defended us.
14. US tax money spent on fixing poverty in other nations rather than US relative poverty. The government's concern should be first and primarily the citizens of our nation. Thus we must fix our own domestic issues before exporting our finances.
15. Exporting American jobs to other countries. How can we justify sending well paying jobs to far off nations we owe nothing to when our own work for minimum wage. Simply we cannot without sacrificing ourselves and our neighbors for the profit of the few.
16. Labor Unions making American labor too expensive. Care for employees is a must but it must be rational for businesses to be able to use American labor.
17. Career politicians. Those who run our country should not have job security as that becomes their loyalty not the people.
18. Politicians encouraging disdain against other groups. Politicians and by association large companies/organizations foster dislike among groups to ensure their voting group stays loyal to them out of hatred for the other group.
19. Overextended copyright laws. Companies should only have so much control over their product or ideas. The general public should not be excluded from advancements or creativity.
20. Unjust invasion of the freedom of speech. Our freedom of speech ends before our fist hits the face of another.
21. Citizens have a right to self protection. Citizens have the right to defend their loved ones and selves from intruders and oppressors foremost and especially their government by means of small arms.
22. Over medication crisis. Overdiagnosis of mental illness and over medication have led to a population using unneeded medication and an over inflation the medication industry.
23. Inadequate mental healthcare facilities. Mental healthcare facilities should have intense funding to make those who suffer with mental illness able to cope. 
24. Restrictions of ex-felons rights to vote. Ex-felons deserve their rights as Americans and if we wish to have less people in prison we must realize their humanity regardless of past trespasses.
25. Underfunded public schooling with faulty curriculum. Education should be one of our top priorities for our children and the future of our nation.
26. Overall negative few of masculinity when compared to femininity. Masculinity is acceptable just as femininity is and neither is. People should be accepted regardless of faulty stereotypes.
27. Unfairly priced college and university making further schooling inaccessible to lower classes. Secondary schooling isn't a right but a need if we want to grow as a nation and as individuals.
28. Obesity crisis unattended to by government. Everyone is entitled to spend their earnings as they please but the government and society at large should encourage the healthy lifestyle of all for the betterment of everyone and the individual.
29. Government and companies making employees fear speaking their mind for the sake of job security. Employees should never be at risk of those their jobs for political disagreements or histories of unpopular beliefs. Only the utmost intolerable views.
30. Internet being treated as an independent enterprise rather than a utility. In the past internet was just a luxury now it is needed for the everyday life of every citizens and should be treated as a utility just as electricity is.
31. Focus on punishment rather than treatment of people with drug usage issues. Rehabilitation is the only way to go about solving our national drug epidemic not punishment. Portugal being a great example of such.
32. Illegality of schedule 1 drugs. People have a right to put what they want into their body so long as it is under their own free will and not at the expense of other in any direct or physical manner.
33. Extreme wealth gap. The average citizen should have more access to the wealth of the nation. However, this should not be done by theft of the 1% via over taxing but through an increase in the minimum wage, a better business environment with for those who give their wealth to projects that further the country, as well as tax incentives for those who fund projects that further the country.
34. Reduction of amount of US military bases globally. We can much better defend our nation if we relocate our spending on unneeded bases and focus on giving benefits to those who have offered themselves to our nation.
35. Lack of initiative in global denuclearization. Global denuclearization should be a main objective of our government as ever person and every nation the world over loses with even a small nuclear conflict. 
36. Less trade dependent policies. We should be a nation first and foremost based within ourselves. We must rely on ourselves and our neighbors before we rely on the outside except in the most desperate of times. This is to protect ourselves from the world at large.",Libertarian,On the US political and cultural atmosphere.

"Theft is a legal term. By law, you have to pay your taxes, and give the government the money that they are entitled to by law. So from the perspective of the law, when you don't pay your taxes, you are actually the one stealing from the government the money that legally belongs to them. 

Law is the glue that holds a society together, and therefore is the only way to objectively define what theft is and what theft isn't in a given society. By law, the x% of money that you pay in taxes belongs to the government, and to not pay it is to be a thief in the eyes of the law, and thiefs are the aggressors.

The only way to view taxes as theft is to take the word ""theft"" outside of just being a legal term, and create an alternate definition. A definition that would probably go along the lines as ""theft, definition 2: when something is taken away from you against your wishes.""

"People making excuses for tyranny is a phenomenon that permeates every society, so let’s look at some of the reasons [why people living with tyranny make excuses for it](http://endofinnocence.com/why-people-make-excuses-for-tyranny/).

First, let’s look at some of the non-controversial empirical  explanations, such as institutionalization and Stockholm syndrome, and  then we will look at some of the more theoretical foundations.

**Institutionalization**

The longer people live in a highly structured institution or culture  where they don’t have to provide for themselves or make any decisions,  such as in a prison or hospital, the more likely they are to get used to  it and to fear being outside of it—as if they were an animal born in a  zoo. Similar environments are military bases, monasteries, schools,  socialism, and communism.

**Stockholm Syndrome**

Hostages often become permanent true believers in the cause of their  captors. In other words, people are likely to become permanent true  believers in the cause of those who wield extreme power over their  lives.

**Purges**

In countries such as China, Cambodia, and the USSR … those people  having any genetic predispositions that made them more likely to value  truth or freedom, to question authority, or to think for themselves  (those who carried the [Soul Of Humanity](http://endofinnocence.com/the-soul-of-humanity/)—the  peak of human evolution) were either killed or imprisoned, and thus  such genes were mostly purged from the gene pool in those countries. In  the 20th century alone, hundreds of millions of people were killed,  imprisoned, or otherwise neutralized by their own governments.

One can easily see how a similar thing happened on a smaller scale again and again throughout history.

Although the European invaders similarly purged the Native Americans,  America has been the best combination of freedom and prosperity for  everyone else, and it has thus collected those individuals who fled such  tyranny elsewhere.

**Illusion Of Legitimacy**

Tyranny often disguises itself as the will of the people so that it will encounter little resistance. This is known as [The Illusion Of Legitimacy](http://endofinnocence.com/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad/).

By masking its use of such tools as: front men, false flag events,  propaganda, rewards, and punishments; the establishment can actually  manipulate the will of the people, which helps it to maintain the  illusion of legitimacy. Naturally, such a manipulated people will then  insist that the will of the establishment is indeed the will of the  people; whereas, the people would naturally rebel if such tools were  obvious and in their face, and if they they could clearly connect their  pain to the will of the establishment.

Of course, such a deceived people are not as irrational as they seem  because for the people to be that deceived in a seemingly open society,  then they would have to be protected from alternative views, which would  require the existence of a globally dominant cabal, which seems  astronomically unlikely—except that we now have a simple, self-evident, [ironclad proof](http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/) that such a globally dominant cabal exists.

**Hierarchy**

Most people feel compelled to comply with the power of those above  them in a hierarchy because those whose genes made them more likely to  challenge those who had the power to kill or punish them would have been  less likely to pass such genes down to future generations.

Dominance hierarchy has been in our genes for hundreds of millions of  years before we were human, so it is not seen as a perversion by hardly  anyone.

**Tribalism**

I’m just going to quote directly from [Racism Explained](http://endofinnocence.com/racism-explained/):

&gt;We are not the product of *everyone* before us. We are the product of *only*  those before us who got the most offspring into future generations. We  are thus the offspring of those men and women, and have the same  genetically programmed impulses that got more of their genes into future  generations. To be clear, *we* have those same genetically programmed impulses.  
&gt;  
&gt;One genetically programmed trait that would help *all* humans  get more of their genes into future generations would be distrust of  those passing through their territory. The reason that distrust of  transients would better protect one’s genes and one’s life, resources,  and offspring is because transients are indeed less trustworthy, because  …  
&gt;  
&gt;*Transients have no stake in the future of your community.*  
&gt;  
&gt;It is obvious how one’s life, resources, and offspring are at far  greater risk from a minute of exposure to transients than from a minute  of exposure to the folks in one’s community. In a nutshell, a transient  has an incentive to take as much from a community as possible before he  moves on, and he would then be harder to track down and punish.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, one’s genes are also at risk in less obvious ways. For  example, a man traveling through a community will feel the genetically  programmed urge to impregnate women there and move on while that  community then has to redirect some of its resources from raising the  children having their genes to the child having the transient’s genes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, the men of a community will have evolved the genetically  programmed urge to kill or drive out the transient out as soon as  possible or make him stay and marry the woman he tried to impregnate; and although that potential pregnancy would give the transient male some small stake in the future of  the community, he has the capacity to move on and impregnate other women in other  communities, so that would be his strongest urge.  
&gt;  
&gt;Genes are not rational however, and it is not as if they can directly evaluate who is transient and who is not …  
&gt;  
&gt;*The genes that protect us from transients would thus operate by making us fear those who look and act differently.*

**Conformism**

Once a particular tyranny is the norm, most people will feel  compelled to conform because the genes that made people less likely to  conform would have made them more likely to be kicked out of the cave  (clan, tribe, etc.), which would have made such genes less likely to get  passed down to us.

Conformism in our genes is probably as [different for men and women](http://endofinnocence.com/men-women-differences-behavior-psychology-evolution/)  as observation and tradition tells us it is because a man who was  kicked out of the cave might survive, but a woman would have died, and a  man who *survived* must have had superior genes, so any women  having a genetic mutation that compelled them to go to the edge of the  territory where such an independent minded male would have found them  would have thus been impregnated by superior genes. Their offspring  would thrive, and we would see some men today who seem compelled to  think for themselves, and we would see many women today who are  attracted to such men. Of course, we would also see many men today who  thus pretend to think for themselves (e.g. politicians).

Consider that those people having the strongest genetic  predisposition to conform will naturally find themselves on the side  where the establishment has their back, and they will naturally be the  biggest defenders of tyranny, which is exactly what we see in America  today with the so-called left.

Until about 1965, America was formed out of those individuals in  other societies who were less likely to conform, and thus the globally  dominant cabal has been trying desperately for about 100 years to change  the demographics of America to be more conformist, and as of 2015, they  had succeeded so thoroughly that they moved on to the next phase in  which they began throwing their success in the face of those who still  cared about America’s founding principles of individual liberty. Such  provocations by agents provocateur, by controlled opposition, and by the  controlled establishment media are obviously intended to provoke a  reaction that could then be used as a pretext to disarm the people, to  create even more of a police state, and to create a global government.

**The Solution**

We’ve all met plenty of people who would rather die than look weird. That’s why [the mainstream is crazy and extreme](http://endofinnocence.com/mainstream-crazy-extreme/). Here is an excerpt from that article:

&gt;The mainstream will support corruption, injustice, and **tyranny** … rather than risk looking extreme.

Now contrast the mainstream with [the people of Cherán, who kicked out the government, and who are doing much better than before](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrPBdLiqMb0).

The people of Cherán have been left alone thus far because they are  basically an Indian reservation, but if they become any bigger of a  threat to the illusion of legitimacy, then unfortunately that threat  will be neutralized—just like every other threat to the illusion of  legitimacy.

Call the system in Cherán whatever you want,  but the people of Cherán kicked out all existing government, and  replaced it with far smaller and more accountable government than  before. Their voluntary militias and their other voluntary  efforts do not count as government because government is a monopoly on the right to  initiate force in a geographical boundary.

No doubt they will make some of the same  mistakes that socialists and communists make, but they seem to be  capable of learning from their mistakes—[just like the first Americans](http://endofinnocence.com/communism-free-markets-plymouth-rock-jamestown/).

The next leap forward could be [The Rule Of Market](http://endofinnocence.com/rule-of-market-anarchy-capitalism-future/), or maybe it will be [The League Of Real People](http://endofinnocence.com/league-real-men/)—or zero squads.",Libertarian,Why People Make Excuses For Tyranny

A defense of which would be: Who spent these notes into circulation to begin with with full knowledge of this to begin with? Why are all federal reserve notes fugitive from the government if that was not the intention to begin with? Furthermore, this means since the government defines and produces these notes they can simply never recognize them for anything beyond this. Are you going to insist upon redeeming them? They will only produce more of the same.

Recently I thought about Inflation as tax, it is really cheap to enforce, you just print more money and pay public servants with additional money. But that would mean citizens use the same currency. That would also mean people with the most savings get taxed the most. Which is unfair in contrast to people who allocate their wealth other ways. Currency would lose their value over time. The speed of inflation would be proportional to the size of government.

Which form of tax would be the most fair? What do you think?

"My mom and I recently had a really bad 'fight' (which was her yelling and me and me being very anxious and crying and her apologizing and me telling her all of the stuff she caused me in the past) and me and my sibling's relationships with our parents have been going somewhat downhill in the past few months, and I guess because of that my mom who does genuinely care for us didn't want to start a fight or cause anymore emotional trouble so she accepted me. 

My dad didn't really care nor has he ever cared about anything we do. I could be a Trump Supporter and he'd just shrug. I'm not a Trump Supporter by the way it was an example. 

My liberal brother yelled at me and said I was stupid and he said he disowned me and said libertarians were all stupid which made me sad considering I ""came out"" right after he talked about how he felt disrespected and ignored by our sister. 

The point is they know. I live in a liberal state where my public school shoves liberal views down our throats and we can only talk about politics if we're liberal. It's so unfair. I can talk about how much I support the LGBT but I can't say factual information about the Wage Gap.

"Hello,

I've been reading up on Rothbard as of late and couldn't quite wrap my head around this one key aspects of his take on Anarcho-Capitalism yet. Namely, the principle of restoring ownership of titles back to the descendants of those people who worked the land originally some years/millenia ago.

I'm also curious how people would go about enforcing that there's no ongoing deception and power games to enforce immoral contracts. Related, how would you go about confronting information asymmetry?

Going from the practical concerns outlined above, I'm not yet convinced of the virtuous nature of labor mixing without regard for the [lockean proviso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockean_proviso). The lockean proviso being a principle that Rothbard intentionally discarded, appealing to the moral virtue (or something?) of the legitimate heirs to the land, instead? How does that come together?

Let's take a look at hypothetical and historic examples:

If I can make the rules as a matter of birthright over a set of scarce, natural resources, then I could see plenty wiggle room there for strategically withholding information from whoever who depends on my decisions (not to forget the opportunities to straight up charge rent). And if, as a result of that, I start accumulating more and more scarce resources that people depend on for their livelihoods, then we could quickly arriving in the situation called 'the tragedy of the commons'.

Consider around 70% of peasants were kicked off of the land of the British lords some 80 years before the industrial revolution, as land started being useful as a commodity (for wool production). *(Source: Varoufakis in some interview; feel free to improve on this source if you get a more dependable account of 17th century Britain)*

Now to further develop the hypothetical: Who is entitled to the land in this case? The lord who inherited it from their ancestors in quite reasonable ways at times, or the peasants who worked it for the most part? Or was there an informal (yet binding) agreement in place between the parties in the pre-mercantilist society that an anarcho capitalist would recognize? How do we come to agree on those matters without equal power between individuals in negotiations? Concerning those issues, what is the basis for consent building focused deliberation in anarcho-capitalism? Seems like a pretty central point if we want to maintain a functional and moral system.

Trying to learn a thing or two here, please help out if you feel so free!

"Hello r/Libertarian

&amp;#x200B;

I have a genuine naive question about libertarian philosophy.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not an expert in economics, so if my question lacks details or is not clear, feel free to ask me to expand on any part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

The main question is the following.

If we accept a completely open free market only driven by free exchange of resources, how can we deal with resource allocation in a system where not all the actors were present at the start of the model? 

&amp;#x200B;

Taking a ""simple"" sandbox model. Let's assume you have only one resource in this model, resource X.

Assumptions:

&amp;#x200B;

* The production of this resource is uniform across the area, meaning any equal surface of the sandbox will produce the same amount of this X.
* Two actors are able to extract this resource, let's call them A and B. They both posses 50% of the total surface.
* The price of the resource is constant, the production rate is constant across time and the resource is self renewable.
* There is always the same amount of demand for this resource, income is constant.

At time T+dT, a third actor appears, he's called C.

&amp;#x200B;

The linked questions are the following:

1. How does C create an income for himself?
2. Is equality of opportunity compatible with this model?
3. If C is a kid from A or B, does that change the answers to question 1 and 2?

"First, obligatory statement on how r/libertarian is the only subreddit that allows these sort of posts. Also, I don't know how to tag this as long, but it is. 

TLDR: Monopoly of force allows for effective conflict resolution and so complex societies

An major issue for libertarians is the infringement of the state on personal autonomy. My argument is that without a monopoly on force, an effective state cannot rise, and instead is limited to small populations. 

In the smallest of human populations, the social group consists of a family or closely related families of 20 or so people. This is the base nomadic group. Interpersonal conflict is limited, as other members have vested interest  in the conflict, such as a person being related to both conflicting parties. This allows for conflicts to be resolved without an central authority, but rather solely interested parties. 

This concept further applies to tribes, consisting of multiple families, or clans. While the interested parties may not be related by blood, they may have a relationship with both opposing parties, and due to the small size of the tribe, an interested party is almost guaranteed. 

Once we get to states, or at least groups of many thousands of people, the likely hood of an interested party dramatically decreases, solely due to statistics - there are so many more unique interpersonal relationships possible. 

This means an central authority is required for effective conflict resolution, as without it,  states will disintegrate to the point where interested parties rise again.  ( Non effective conflict resolution causes conflict, preventing effective society untill conflict is resolved due to poor social conduct)

So where does monopoly of force (MOF) enter. If an conflicting party or parties are capable of a large amount of force, they can continue the conflict regardless of the central authority, unless the central authority has greater force. In order to do so, it must hold a monopoly of force to be able to provide effective conflict resolution. 

Counter arguments include
- maybe smaller social groups are better then? But this loses the major benfits of larger societies, perhaps the most important being the releasing of a people from food production

- if the central authority has a monopoly of force, how do you change the central authority? This argument is perhaps the strongest. You could argue that democracy is an excellent tool for allowing this, or that monopoly of force should always be able to be undone through civil unrest of an entire population. No easy answer here, but this argument doesn't really attack the concept of MOF being needed for complex societies.

- But what if the central authority is biased? My argument directly avoids this question, because in truth it likely will be. The first part is that it doesn't matter in terms of compex societies, as the key point is that conflicts are resolved. The second is that increasingly complex societies allow for more complex organisations such as judical systems. 

If you made it this far, nice work.  I'm always keen to hear counter arguments, and if you are worried that your argument will be missed, feel free to DM me.

"I'm not trying to be hostile, i just would like to expand my knowledge.
I understand the basic principles of libertarianism, but I've always had a few questions I would like to ask a libertarian.

1) If there is no tax and everyone is left to their own devices
    - Wouldn't there need to be a rebalancing of society? Otherwise the rich would stay super rich and the poor would be screwed over?

2)Speaking of the poor, does libertarianism not screw them over? Yes they lose less money to sales tax etc, but they dont get income taxed below a certain level, and because orher people pay tax they can presumably enjoy a higher quality of life because of that. Please explain this to me.

"I'm going to summarize some of the talking points mentioned in this hour long video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOydDwDiElY) because it's an interesting topic of discussion, something this community needs more than memes. 

**WA Arguments**
The WA lawyer starts off by calling Cody Wilson a crypto-anarchist, and begins to rattle off his arguments for why the files shouldn’t be distributed. His first talking point being that the internet is not sectioned off, allowing release in certain areas and that release would be worldwide. This eventually plays into his argument for the files being more available to terrorists and could potentially disrupt whatever “peace” currently exists. 

His second major point is that the weapons cannot be detected with metal detectors. The implications of this would mean that airports, stadiums, and schools could be at increased risk. He fails to mention that bullets are still metal and detectable. The undetectable firearms act plays a large role in his arguments, trying to reinforce the fact that these files will lead to unlawful manufacturing. 

The most laughable point is how he states that certain manufacturers depend on licenses given by the State, and that citizens manufacturing on their own would hurt those firms. If there was no licensing in the first place this wouldn’t even be a talking point. Giving those firms a degree of monopoly power through a license is advantageous to the State anyway. You can see the fear in this guy throughout the video. 

When discussing the 1st amendment he asserts that since a plastic gun is currently illegal, the 3d guns have no 1st amendment protections. His last few bits of arguing points revolve around the fact that the president seems to agree that they’re a danger to public safety and that as the UNITED States of America, military type information should be regulated for the benefit of public safety. 

**State arguments**
The lawyer for the dept of State was up next, immediately explaining how the government will “vigorously enforce the undetectable firearms act”. The judge begins asking how something that is undetectable is “vigorously enforced against”. The lawyer replies that the federal government is currently successful at finding illegal items such as drugs, and will continue to do so. Towards the end he also adds that just because something is dangerous doesn’t make it a critical military or intelligence advantage and that right now, as long as it’s less than 50cal and not automatic, it would be considered legal. 

**Thoughts**

Hopefully some of you found this post useful and I look forward to seeing some discussion!

If the state decides that the value of a Deflar cent rose so much it is difficult to transact, the state simply issues another unit, for ex a Deflar penny (1 D cent = 100 D pennies).
