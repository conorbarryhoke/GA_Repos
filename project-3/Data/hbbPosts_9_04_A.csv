"The human being a bro in this story is my sister. This may or may not belong here. She didn‚Äôt save a drowning puppy or donate a limb, but she did a thing and I want you to know about it. 

My sister has a daughter (my niece) who just started high school.  She is kind, timid, very self conscious, a bit sensitive and has the kindest heart of anyone I know. She puts everyone else‚Äôs feelings before her own, even when she shouldn‚Äôt. A friend of hers moved in with my sister‚Äôs family about a year ago.  From that day on, everything she had, became her friends too. It wasn‚Äôt even a question, she just did it. 

Adding another teenager to the family isn‚Äôt without its challenges, but they‚Äôre adjusting. The girls have now started high school and have joined different activities but still have the same group of friends. This particular night, the girls would be going to a big event at their school. My niece had practice right after school and wouldn‚Äôt be home for a couple hours. 

When my sister got home from work, she checked in with the friend as well as 2 other girls the friend had invited over.  They were in the girls room (which they share) getting ready. My sister then noticed that the 3 girls had gotten matching outfits/costumes for the event. The girls had gone shopping after school and picked up the items. My sister asked if they had gotten a set for my niece. They had not. My sister knew that her daughter would come home and see she‚Äôd been left out when they had all planned to go together.  She knew this would secretly crush my niece. My sister took the friend aside and asked to see the items for the outfit.  She flew out of the house and made it to the store at record speed. She got back and spoke privately to the friend. ‚ÄúYou two are family. Sister‚Äôs don‚Äôt forget about each other.‚Äù  

My sister then gave the friend and the other 2 girls, the items she had just picked up. ‚ÄúIt was so nice of you girls to pick these up for [niece] when you were out.  We don‚Äôt need to talk about this again.‚Äù  My niece came home a few minutes later. They all got ready in their matching outfits and off they went.

,HumansBeingBros,Feeding the Homeless Wall Cat
"In late 2016 my depression got much, much worse after years of fighting it.

After a daft argument with my dad I left the house and walked towards a tall bridge in town to throw myself off, but a lady I did not know was concerned about me and asked if I was ok. I was shocked that someone would care and broke down, she gave me a hug and asked if she could call my parents for me. She waited with me until they arrived despite just finishing a long shift. All I told her was that I had an argument, I never told her where I was going.

The next day I called a helpline to ask for advice about my depression, and that started a series of events that lead to the disability behind my illness getting diagnosed.

I never saw that lady again, but she saved my life by showing me that the world wasn‚Äôt a completely dark place. I just wish I could find her and thank her in some way. Just a reminder that if someone looks distressed, ask them how they are. You might save a life.",HumansBeingBros,A woman unknowingly saved my life

"I'm a woman who is standing outside a grocery store right now, beside the family car, smoking a cigarette. My parents and young nephew are inside the store. I don't smoke around my nephew, hence me being outside alone. The older gentleman who owns the car next to where I'm standing just came out of the store, loaded up his car, and got in.

Then he rolled down his window and said, ""Excuse me, ma'am. Are you okay?""

It's important to note that at this moment, I don't appear very okay. I am very clumsy, and recently I sustained some very noticeable injuries falling on a concrete pool deck. My right leg is bruised and all scraped up, my left arm is bruised, my face has a few scratches. I have a baby face and I'm not wearing makeup, so even though I'm 25, I probably look about 16. I have resting bitch face and I'm smoking, so taking all of that into consideration, I doubt I look like I'm doing okay even though I am.

But this sweet older man just had to stop and make sure. It was a brief moment, but it made me very happy that he wanted to check on me.

I‚Äôm in a marching band and we‚Äôre a very very good band. Division 1 every year. We have a pretty big band, and we practice during the summer, and school is starting soon so the other sports came out and started practice every week. Today during practice while we were doing workouts, after football practice got out for lunch 3 players drove by in the parking lot screaming profanities and other inappropriate things at someone because they were having trouble with one of the exercises and couldn‚Äôt do it. He‚Äôs a small guy, maybe 5‚Äô7 and 110 pounds. One of their coaches almost immediately ran out and helped the guy out and showed him how to do the exercise and proceeded to bench those players when they got back. They‚Äôre suspended for two weeks and only playing for three games this season. ",HumansBeingBros,Couldn‚Äôt get a picture
