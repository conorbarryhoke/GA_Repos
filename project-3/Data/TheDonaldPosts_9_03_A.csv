"Shared on my FB today, and thought I would share here.

Dear FB Friends,

Good Afternoon and Happy Labor day. This post is a ""coming out"" of sorts, and the thoughts contained here are going to be wildly unpopular to most of my friends list. Nevertheless, I feel its important for a multitude of reasons for me to be forthright about who I am and what I believe. 
Some of you already know my political affiliation as of this past election, some of you probably wonder if I have had a change of heart as I've been moreorless silent since then, and some of you may have no idea or only some idea based upon my activity in your FB feeds. While the idea of civil discourse is ideal if we disagree (how else can we discover and explore the truth?) I recognize that civility has become a commodity at this time in our history, and if personal attacks or defriending ensues as a result of this proclamation, then that is what it is. I am not interested in policing anyone's words or thoughts. My tolerance ends where threats to the safety of my family and I begin (Unfortunately, this is a rational fear and largely the reason I have been so silent) Now, I'll be the first to admit, that during election time, I allowed my emotions to overcome my logic more times than I care to admit, and it is of utmost importance to me that I not allow personal attacks to either fuel me or deterr me from speaking the truth. I've learned the hard way that alienating ourselves in our own thoughts and echo chambers does not help us grow or reflect or get to the bottom of the truth, or to spreas it. It only stifles the quest for it- something I've realized is a prized possession of those who wish to control it, and something we have all taken for granted.

In this video, you will find two of my closest family members. My mother, and my aunt. For most of my adolescent and early adult life, I thought I had very little in common with them, and I tried to avoid any topics of contention to maintain a peaceful relationship. Of course, those are always the topics that matter most. That said, while my parents were struggling through all eight years of Obama's presidency because their jobs had been eliminated due in part to his policies, and while my mother was paying out of pocket for vital surgeries because their premiums nearly quadrupled and their deductible went from 2k to 15k, I never really showed them any kind of support or understanding. Mainly because I was young with little life experience of any kind and didn't really know anything about anything. I was told Obamacare made healthcare accessible for all. But ""accessible"", I realized, was a deceptive word used by design, as it was true that health care was accessible for all in that every person could say, ""hey, I have health insurance"", but a majority of those people would never actually be able to use it unless they became terminally ill and went into debt before having a chance to use it. ""How misleading"", I thought. Red flag #1. For the first half of Obama's presidency, I sang his praises happily. By the second half, the reality of his ""change"" started to seep in. The targeting of conservative voices and demonizing of American values, the smearing of these conservatives and movements like the tea party as racist hate groups (I attended one of these rallies with my Ninny, cousin, and mother, and there wasn't a shred of racism or violence), the constant disdain for the slightest display of national pride, a sudden and urgent crusade against all white males and police, and the simultaneous portrayal of any white person who isn't utterly ashamed of their existence to be blatantly racist and bigoted, denial of benefits and appreciation to our military, allowing U.S. citizens to die abroad with no concern or intervention, increased military presence in Afghanistan, failure to condemn terrorists both foreign and domestic, using domestic terrorism to further an agenda for gun control and world domination, the appointment of a cabinet consisting almost entirely of big bankers, and yet the Occupy Movement was abound by people who supported Obama and his policies...I could go on. The miseducation, disinformation, manipulation, and disdain for all tradition made me realize what Obama's Change really meant. All of his words and actions began to look less and less like Change I Could Believe In and more like a slow, permissible, tyrannical death to America- the place I call home and the place which I believe still stands apart from every other nation in the world, regardless of its hideous injustices, to which there are many, but that are matched also by charity and freedoms never before seen in the history of mankind. I did not vote for Obama in 2012. I did not vote for anyone.

By the end of Obama's second term, I was relieved that he was leaving office, though anxious about what was to come. Mostly, I had lost hope altogether that America could be salvaged in any way, as over the ladder half of his presidency I realized that both parties only existed to create the illusion of choice. I realized our government was deeply corrupt on both sides and that it would take a miracle to regain any kind of lawful order or respect for our Constitution, our system of checks and balances, our history (which has been methodically manipulated in our history books over generations) and any sense of national pride. It seemed no one really cared about these things anymore; that our violent history supersceded our most honorable accomplishments and that our identities as it relates to our hierarchy of oppression became the defining principle of how we were going to reconstruct society. The indoctrination of Marxist ideology of children in our public school systems (of which I am a product of- though unsuccessfully) and in our Universities became palpable as people I've known since elementary and middle school began making radical statements and spewing hate for America while at the same time lamenting that patriotism itself is hate speech. When BLM came on the scene, I was swiftly reprimanded for supporting police, black lives, and white lives. I was constantly at odds with people in my life feeling as though I was supporting ""the wrong side"" and was ""part of the problem"". I was told I was guilty of condoning systemic racism and in effect; was racist. After this, I stood back. I looked around. I questioned myself. Was I racist? Did showing respect for my black neighbors mean I had to hold myself and all white people and police in contempt? Why? 

I did not like what I found. When I stood back, I realized what was happening. Black, white, latino, gay, straight, trans, Republican, Democrat- we were all being conditioned to hate our neighbors. I realized the fabric of American society- the freedom to be who we are- was being systematically broken down from the inside out. I realized this was what our elite government wanted for us. Because while we tear each other apart in hypocritical moral outrage over the latest politically exploited catastrophe, our ""leaders"" were making backroom deals, rewiring government policies in their favor without us ever knowing, commiting fraudulent, treasonous deals with our enemies, trafficking and abusing children under the guise of humanitarian aid (Re: Haiti), and fueling the flames of division to keep us distracted so we would never realize their true intentions.

Then Trump came along. Like most people, I was unsure what to make of his orange complexion and floppy yellow hair on my television screen during the presidential election. The stages went something like this: 

Shock, Amusement, Secret Curiosity, Horror, Shock, Serious Curiosity, Research, Observation, Understanding, Support.

Notice how far into these stages ""Research"" is. Why was I not paying attention earlier on?

Because I was under the influence. Of media, of friends, of family, of shame, of fear. I was allowing the opinions of others to dictate my thoughts and actions. 

It took a long time for me to peel back all the layers of lies that led me to understand that voting for Trump was the only way to save America from a global socialist takeover and constitutional annihilation. 

If it sounds crazy and outrageous, that's because it's true; and if you're still watching CNN or MSNBC or any number of MSM stations- including Fox News, you probably aren't used to hearing it. 

The New World Order is a real thing thats been projected as Conspiracy Theory for decades now. The closer we get to the realization of the NWO agenda, the more hear about it, and the more people are waking up to it.

It's no longer about Democrat vs. Republican. It's about Freedom vs. Tyranny. Good vs. Evil. Life vs. Death.

Trump was elected because enough people have finally woken up and our collective consciousness has shifted. As unbelievable as it may be for most highly educated liberal democrats to believe, blue collar people on the right- or ""rednecks"" as people of superior intellect like to call them, are grounded in common sense and motivated by Constitutional moral values that happen to be the only remaining Constitutional voices left in this country. They've witnessed this destruction for decades, they were criticized, ostraziced, and forgotten. That was the downfall of the Democrat party. That is why Trump was elected, and why he will be elected again.

I voted for Trump so that he would destroy the traitorous politicians that have infiltrated every faction of our government and society. I voted for him because he answered to no one but the people who elected him. I voted for him because he cares about the law. He cares about people- all people- even those who hate him- and their ability to live a life of liberty and happiness. I voted for Trump because he gets things done. He isn't afraid of doing what must be done and he isn't afraid of offending. He isn't perfect or ""presidential"" in presentation, but he certainly has America's best interests at heart.

There are currently over 50,000 sealed indictments that have yet to be revealed. Our government will be purged of corruption from every corner of both political aisles. 

When my mother began working on her book, ""Just The Tweets"", a compilation of all of Trump's tweets of the first year of his presidency, she asked me if I would be interested in helping her. Even though I wanted to help, and wanted to show my support, I told her I couldn't, because I was worried about possible professional repercussions, as well as fearing for the safety of my family. I repeat, I was worried about the safety of myself and my family. I still am.

But what example am I setting for my son when he one day asks me what happened to America and I say, ""Well, it was destroyed, and I was too afraid to do anything about it"". What world will he be living in? So, I will not be silenced any longer. As Deep State operatives continue to undermine Trump's accomplishments and try to desperately control media narratives, Americans can see their blatant desperation and it is more vital than ever for those on the fence to wake up to the truth. As they say in the X- Files- ""the truth is out there"".

So, friends, I love my country. I love God. I support President Trump. I am part of and applaud the #WalkAway movement- which you should really check out if you haven't already. I am not a Russian bot. I am pro-life and I believe in the right to bare arms and freedom of speech. I love everyone the same as I always have. But I will not be intimidated into silence any longer. That's me- take it or leave it. 😘✌🇺🇸
