"We are two of r/democrats more vocal members from opposite sides of the aisle. /u/Caveliertunes speaks out for Progressives and I, /u/backpackwayne, encourage the more Centrist view. We both have our arguments, and we both do our best to convince others of our position. But with exactly two months until a crucial election, we have decided to join together and urge unity, if only for a short time. 
 The following are statements are from each of us and we only ask that you listen.


-----------------


**From /u/backpackwayne:**

The Democratic Party has been in a struggle for control for over two years now, and this battle has taken its toll. Republicans are giddy as we are doing their job for them. Progressives and Centrists want the same things but differ on how to achieve them. But we do want the same things. Putting that aside, it is time to look at reality. If democrats do not win back the house and/or the senate in this election, we will face another two years of our democracy being shredded by an inept and callous Trump administration. They will stack the courts, take away our rights, abuse and pollute our justice system, destroy our environment, and eliminate any chance for universal healthcare for at least a decade.

The fight for the left should take place in the primaries. **THE PRIMARIES ARE NOW OVER!**  In the next two months we must unite and fight for the candidates that have been chosen. If we don’t, it won’t matter who controls the left. We can get back to that battle later after the election. It is imperative that we put aside our differences for the time being and stop fighting with each other. We all know who the real threat to our democracy is. So please stop this infighting and join together to achieve step one our both our goals. We need to first stop the bleeding and prevent any further damage by gaining control of at least one chamber of Congress. As a united front, there is no stopping us. Divided we face the worst threat to our democracy in yours and my lifetime.

-----------------


**From /u/Caveliertunes:**

Understandably, there are still many hurt feelings and resentment left over from 2016. We all understand. Many Progressives feel unwelcome and belittled. Many Centrists feel like they are consistently under attack. If you feel like your fellow Democrats who are of an alternative viewpoint are not respecting you, remember they likely feel the same way. Empathy is an important trait to have right now. It is something we have over the Republican Party; it is something we need to utilize—not only to defeat them but to work together. We, as a party, must be able to combine our efforts if we are to achieve any of our goals. Perhaps it is ironic that the man who said it best was a Republican himself, Abraham Lincoln: ""A house divided against itself, cannot stand.""

We may not ever all completely agree, but that is what makes us great. That is what makes us strong and resilient! As many have often said: we are a ""big tent party."" We can disagree; we can like different politicians; we can debate about the issues. However, we cannot waver: **Not now!** 

**THE PRIMARIES ARE NOW OVER.** Progressives and Centrists both had significant victories in the primaries this year, and it is becoming increasingly evident that both sides have a place in the Democratic Party. We all have a voice, and those voices are heard loud and clear. However, once the primaries end, we need to put aside any lingering resentment and work toward achieving our common goal. We've all decided that the Republican Party is dangerous! Even if we can't get everything we want out of the election, we can at least achieve that shared objective.

Progressivism is necessary to push forward toward ideals we must achieve as a nation. Centrism is essential to moderate, balance, and work pragmatically when needed, so we don't fizzle out before the fight begins. We are sides of the same coin. We are all necessary for a complete and robust Democratic Party. Progressives and Centrists are both the ""base"" of the party: We need one another! Let's make sure we find ourselves in a position where we can affect policy and help both the party and the country grow!

Respect one another. Respect each other's points of view and preferences. Let's show a united front now and in November, and grind out our differences after the election.

To that article of Michelle, I like to add that the funeral of a ""Maverick"" John McCain has shown the contrast between a hero and an ugly human being called Trump.

Trump who's built a career degrading and insulting contestants in his talk show, is repeating his act while sitting in the White House.

He came into political arena first by trying to dehumanize our first Black president Obama by questioning his legitimacy to the throne by calling him a non-American. Even Obama's revealing the original birth certificates didn't convince the son of a racist monster called Fred Trump who might've lynched an unverifiable number of Black and minority folks in his lifetime.

So to the psychiatrists and psychologists, it is quite natural that a son of a vicious racist murderer has to be another racist murderer. 

Just like his father, there is hardly any account about how many murders or tortures of Black and minorities that Trump had ordered in his lifetime. 

But even without any evidence we know that Trump is capable of committing totally racist actions because we've seen him praising the White Supremacists/ Nationalists who not only killed an innocent woman but tore up the reputation of a peaceful town in Virginia by starting a pitched battle against the their opposition members who didn't like their chanting of Nazi slogans,""Blood and soil"" and ""Jews won't replace us.""

What did Trump say to those anti-Jew, anti-Black and anti- minority haters ?

"In today's OP-ED ""They Sat in Hypocrisy"" in NYT David Leonhardt gave a clear picture of what those Republican honchos are, the ones attended John McCain's funeral sitting near the front  in Washington National Cathedral  : They're hypocrites. 
 
David was also right when he told us this in his piece ""Congressional Republicans made a show of honoring John McCain even as they continue to reject his principles.""

To David's lines I also like to add that if hypocrisy was the only word in the dictionary to describe what the congressional Republicans are, then maybe we could give them a pass.

But there are some real ugly words written in the dictionary that could be used here to describe a bunch of 'compromats'.

From being strong Russia foes, the current Republican Party is Russia  lovers now.

They forgot that their ideal president in the eighties Ronald Reagan hated Soviet Union then. He was the president who said famously on June 12,1987,""General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate ! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall."" 

No wonder then General Secretary of Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev got scared and tore down the Berlin Wall separating West Germany and it's eastern communist counterpart. Russians then, unlike now under their current President Putin, didn't hesitate to do what an American president wanted them to do because of a 3 : 1 advantage in nuclear arsenals that our United States had over Soviet Union throughout the eighties.

Even Democratic President Kennedy before that caught the First Secretary of the communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khruschev's bluff in 1962 and forced him to withdraw all the nuclear missiles from Cuba after our American president made them to sign an agreement on November 20,'62. This humiliating experience for a Soviet leader happened after a harrowing and very frightful 13 days, known as Cuban missile crisis that started on October 16th and lasted till October 28th, in 1962.

But what are the current honchos in the G.O.P. are doing right now?

They're giving in to their current president Trump's demands that America should be subservient to the current Russian premier Putin, no matter what.

No wonder the big shots of the Republican party are now doing just that . 

Although this bunch of Republicans looked so quiet and respectful looking at the coffin of Mr. McCain at the Capitol rotunda but that was just a front, nothing else . 

What we didn't notice on our tv screens was that although the big names from the Republican party stood in silence and looked mournful at their Senator John McCain's funeral but we know for sure that they'd not do what their friend and ex-colleague wanted them to do.

These Republican leeches have no desire to show any true respect to the ""Maverick""'s real desire before he succumbed to the brain cancer : to stop Russia from meddling in our elections.

Why ?

Because Mr. McCain's Senate and House leaders know only one thing, ""Country be damned if we can't keep the congress in our control.""

Go figure !",democrats,Trump's leeches in the Republican Party tried to put up a front at Senator McCain's funeral. They tried to show us that they'd follow his wishes. But as soon as they left the church they're back into using Trump's Russian friends to hack in to the Dem members' computers to win their midterms.

"Obviously this is deeply concerning, as this is a judge who will potentially preside over decisions regarding our corrupt president.

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

"News article: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/susan-collins-brett-kavanaugh-roe-v-wade_us_5b8963d5e4b0511db3d7d20d?jz8

It’s becoming clear that Trump nominated Kavanaugh at least partly to protect himself and his personal and family corruption from investigation. From shady deals with the Saudis that could be benefitting his personal business empire to arranging alleged payoffs for women, Trump is doing whatever he can to escape scrutiny.

Only the Senate can stop him, and the most important swing vote to #stopkavanaugh is Maine Senator Susan Collins.

Collins previously promised to “fix” the health insurance market, which would save access to health care for millions of Americans.

Instead, with a vote to confirm Kavanaugh she would let Trump destroy health care access for people in Maine and across the country, and help shield Trump from investigation. 

Be A Hero PAC started a fundraising effort to kick start an opponent to Collins if she votes for Kavanaugh:

"My dad is jumped on the Trump train hard. So hard, that he honestly believes that Trump is the reincarnation of Lincoln.  He's a loyal viewer of Fox News. He is able to rattle off facts and figures about the Trump presidency because of how much he watches Fox. We got into a fairly heated discussion this past weekend about what Trump has done so far in his presidency. My dad asserts that the tariffs to our allies have been great for the economy, because he thinks that countries like Canada have been screwing America over in trade for decades. He also loves Trump's hard-line stance on immigration as he feels loose borders drain our social service dollars, which hurts our economy. I believe that these things are false, but I'd like to be armed with facts and sources the next time we have a conversation. 

  

He also doesn't care about how Trump acts ""unpresidential"". I believe that he's doing real harm to the world order we've helped craft post-WWII. He thinks that Trump is ""who he is"" and we have to support him because he's doing real good for the country.

"In his Op-Ed piece called ""The Commander of Fear"" Charles M . Blow has taken Trump to the task with another sentence saying, ""Trump's magical mixture is to make being afraid feel like fun.""

To show my appreciation for Mr. Blow's column, I like to add my line saying this : We democrats have no illusion that Trump could only run with a Republican ticket in 2016. 

Why ?

Because we on the left would've given him no ground to start his campaign with the most divisive language like, ""Mexicans are bringing....."" like Charles mentioned in his Op-Ed.

Actually if fear could be used as a weapon then the Republican party was guilty of always welcoming all of their candidates whoever had fear mongering messages. And they did it for a very long time. 

No wonder Trump took full advantage of a ready made audience that the Republicans had nurtured for a almost a century.

He came up with some of the most outlandish claims that any other Americans had ever come up with. 

By announcing Obama's presidency illegal, Trump started spreading this rumor that our first Black president was not born in America but in his father's native land Kenya.

Almost all the Republicans jumped on the same hoax spread by Trump saying in unison that ""if Obama was not born here, he could not be president of this country.""

What nobody told Trump on his ugly face was, ""So what ?""

With his White Kansas born American mother, Obama had as much claim to the throne as John McCain who was born on Panamanian waters as we've seen in his birth certificate issued by a hospital in Panama. 

But none of that was a concern for the morons who filled up the higher echelons of G.O.P. 

So with ""Here it goes again"" sounding all over the country with ""The Commander OF Fear"" as Mr. Blow addressed him in his piece, Trump and his leeches are spreading one fear after another squashing all the civility that this country grew up with. 

Trump's sponsored candidate DeSantis of Florida went one step further by insinuating while using a bull horn on Fox Tv that his Black opponent for Governor, ""is a Monkey"".

Go figure !",democrats,"Trump will burn in hell for spreading one fear mongering counterpoint after another using many bullhorns with totally racist undertones. Even DeSantis, his sponsored Republican candidate in Florida Governor's race used the word ""Monkey' to describe his Black opponent."

"As Dr. Thomas L. Friedman rightly said in his Op-Ed today in NYT, ""What if Trump Did Actually Shoot Someone on Fifth Avenue ?"" where the famous columnist has cautioned us on the left warning us saying ""Your vote in the midterms matters, because republicans in Congress won't restrain the president's excesses.""

Actually this type of warnings came to us two days in a row by two different gentlemen who really care about America, by Paul Krugman yesterday. And Dr. Friedman today.

But it's the Evangelicals who're still supporting Trump even after their meeting with their president day before yesterday who  should be really fearful of their fate. Those pastors and their congregation should realize that by supporting a pure evil called Trump they're praying to the Devil, not Jesus.

Being associated with the Devil himself or an incarnation of Lucifer called Trump, those Christian leaders and their congregation should be ashamed of calling themselves Christians.

Those apostles have to realize that they're in cahoot with a man who said in his campaign stops that his supporters would still vote for him even if he ""shot someone on the Fifth Avenue"" the subject of the Op-Ed in NYT today.

Although Dr. Friedman's column is fictional but Trump has such a sway over his followers in the Republican Party who'll look the other way even if Trump shoots someone totally unprovoked on Fifth Avenue in New York or on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C.

Even the Senators like Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul are ready to trash their colleague and best friend John McCain's legacy and his wishes of calling Russia's president Putin, ""a thug"" even a few days before his death from brain cancer.

As no one knows yet how much help the Russians extended to both of the above Republican Senator's reelection campaigns, those two Senators and other stalwarts from G.O.P. sure like to overlook Russian intervention in our last election which catapulted not only Trump in the Oval office of White House. 

The Russians helped majority of the Republican congressional candidates to destroy their Democratic opponents' chances of winning elections by hacking and publishing their small infractions with the law like not paying their parking tickets years ago.

I cannot believe that Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and other senior members of the Republican party like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan do not have any clue about Russian intervention in our elections in 2016. The fact is, they know.

Or if they don't know they should ask Mr. Mueller. He knows what Russians did.",democrats,"Evangelicals,who're still supporting Trump even after their meeting with him where he said, ""There'll be violence after election"" should pray to Devil instead of Jesus.

"NY-23 has the opportunity to elect the first cyber security expert to congress. [Tracy Mitrano](https://tracymitranoforcongress.com/) is running against incumbent Tom Reed, a long time Trump supporter. Mitrano is the former director of information technology policy for Cornell University. She's running on a campaign of universal healthcare, net neutrality, and accessible higher education.

Currently NY-23 is rated as R +6 according to Cook voter index. Voters are apathetic about Tom Reed, and turnout is usually low. In the democratic primaries, more votes were cast than in any primary since the redistricting about 7 years ago.

This is a very winnable race. Congress desperately needs someone with experience in information technology and cyber security, especially as nature of election interference has begun moving into the digital age. The [videos of congress trying to ask Mark Zuckerberg questions about facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0) should be a red flag that our current congress is not prepared to handle these threats. Tracy Mitrano is one (if not the only) congressional candidate qualified to handle these kinds of hearings.

​

Locally, many big manufacturing plants have been shutting down. Thousands have lost their jobs in the last year alone. Pollution from a nuclear plant neat the great lakes remains a concern. Opioid addiction continues to rip through the community. Much of the land here is farm land, and will be hit by Trump tariffs.

Mitrano needs help. Reed is backed by multiple pharmaceutical companies, and several other big lobbying firms. She needs name recognition and much more media attention than local newspapers can give her.

​

If you can give money, time, or just words of encouragement the campaign can use it all. @ her campaign on twitter. Tag her in stories about election meddling and cyber security. Write post cards to voters. Donate a couple bucks. If you're in the area, join us going door to door. Buy signs and bumper stickers. Write in opinion pieces to local newspapers in the district.

​

With some help, this race can flip. It's marked ""safe R"" by most forecasts, but in this climate this one is an excellent bet for a surprise upset.",democrats,Tracy Mitrano - NY23

"BY his OP-Ed in today's NYT called ""Why It Can Happen Here"" Dr. Paul Krugman has given a stern warning to all the Americans.

Actually his warning is more towards us on the left than the Americans on the right when he said this very frankly, ""We're very close to becoming another Poland or Hungary.""

While appreciating Dr. Krugman's comments, I also like to put my own input on the subject by informing our Dem members of congress and Dem, Liberal, Progressive and Bernie's Independent voters that we're at the edge of a precipice if we don't take this upcoming midterms seriously.

I just like to remind our voters that there are still millions of Republican supporters who voted for Trump in 2016. These Trump voters voted for him not having any clue who they were voting for.

They just went to the poling booths to vote for a narcissistic sycophant who initially used dog whistle to question our first Black president Obama's place of birth to put him in the spot light.

Next, he literally blew a big trumpet to announce his candidacy for the presidency by using senseless jingoism and pointed attacks on the Mexicans in particular, immigrants in general.

And now as we're nearing two years of Trump's ascendancy to the throne once coveted by ideal Republican presidents like Abe Lincoln and Gen. David ""Ike"" Eisenhower and Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter and John Kennedy, we're almost at the edge of the Abyss where any mistake by our countrymen to put the same Republican party in power after November's midterms will put our country towards the dictatorship that we've only read in the Newspapers or watched on tv.

Yes, it's true that we've never seen a dictator in this great country which functioned as a Democracy for almost 300 hundred years. 

Hope we do not have to see now with Trump turning into a totally rogue dictator starting January 1st, 2019.

That is the only reason why this upcoming elections are so important for the existence of America and the prevalence of American values that were instilled on July 4th 1776.

We should not also forget our Constitution that was ratified on June 21,1788. And the 27+ Amendments which sealed the deal against an impending authoritarian regime that Trump is going to bring in if the Republicans are kept in power in both the chambers of congress after the midterms on November 6th.",democrats,"By not lowering the flag initially for late Sen.

,democrats,O’Rourke: Texas should lead the way on true criminal justice reform [Opinion]
"The subject of impeachment is one of, if not the, most debated issues for democrats heading into the midterms. For the purpose of argument, I'll assume the Democratic Party's primary goal is the removal of Trump from office as quickly as possible. 

The party leadership appears to have taken the position that I will define as strategic. They believe, based on Bill Clinton's experience, that a failed attempt at impeachment will backfire, prolonging Trump's term. Consequently, they are choosing to focus on convincing voters to vote for opponents of Trump which would both signal Trump's unpopularity and legitimate the threat of impeachment.

I believe a competing set of arguments exists which i will define as civic. This can be broadly summarized as the (correct) belief that Trump is a clear and present danger to the republic and congress should constrain the president in any manner necessary up to and including impeachment and reform and prosecuting and reforming political and bureaucratic institutions that knowingly behaved criminally during or leading to the Trump presidency. Those in the civic camp would argue that a congressional candidate that does recognize the existential threat of a Trump presidency and campaign on their desire to impeachment is neglecting their patriotic duty at the expense of partisanship.

I think we should try to find a compromise between these two groups that will get to impeachment fastest. I think voters want both strategists and civics. I think the democratic party and its candidates need to determine a way to identify themselves as pro-impeachment without undermining their positions through demonstrations of partisanship.

IMO politicians should work to convince their constituents that Trump is a clear and present threat to the republic from an objective basis. This should be treated like climate change. We have to work to prove incontrovertibly that Trump is currently doing irreparable damage to the United States and must be removed from office as soon as possible for the good of the country and the world.

"**PragerU's video about Immigration is the worst, poorly researched and stereotypical right view on Immigration. So I thought, with sources and ACTUAL research the REAL FACTS about Immigration.**  

The United States cannot dis-allow immigration. With a poor education system, H1B and EB visa holders are essential for growth (1). Even with STEM (which is still failing), the soft-nationalist view that Immigration is just ""unneeded space."" They gave the number of Immigrants to the US, and implied that they are useless. But in reality, not only are they productive and better workers, they CREATE jobs for the American people. This is true amongst the tech sector especially: with the Silicon Valley practically created by Immigrants and the H1B visa (2). Infact, the US economy is SUFFERING from restrictions on visas (3)! And while Trump claims an ""economic victory"" because the economy has hit the highest points in history (which is true, but unstable and not because of Trump), he needs to learn that immigrants are actually NEEDED to keep America ""great"".

"Charles M. Blow has given us a fantastic Op-Ed in today's NYT called ""Opera of Demons"". 

By using very intelligent analogy Mr. Blow told us what we wanted to hear. 

He said what we're witnessing right now all over the American is nothing but a devilish opera staged by Trump and his leeches.

Charles also told us that ""Trump has created a series of odd bedfellows.""

With the same Op-Ed, the writer has given us an up to date account of the strange drama being played out in our court rooms where one after another of Trump's confidantes are jumping in the pit after taking Mr. Mueller's bait to implicate their co-conspirator in a high crimes and misdemeanor scenario.

Some ugly Americans on Trump's side like Rudy Giuliani is trying to con the entire country by saying ""Truth isn't truth.""  He doesn't know that we know better.

But there is one good thing to this opera where some of the con artists have decided to switch their designated roles and implicate their president Trump. 

Adding to Charles's description of the ""Opera of Demons', I like to add that only if Trump ever read the red colored Bible his mother gave him at age ten, he could gain an important knowledge from an early age of his life, that is ""Every sin brings its own consequences.""

Being born in a racist family and leading a totally corrupted lifestyle in an opulent atmosphere, Trump bred into corruption himself.

A thoroughly racist Trump grew up in a house where his father Fred was always putting his own prejudiced views in his young son's head by always saying to a young Donald, ""Never show any compassion for the downtrodden"" which in Fred Trump's world meant only the minorities in general, Black folks in particular.

So here we've a man, who had said right after his inauguration,""I want to be the president of all the Americans"", is deliberately running the most divisive administration ever.

And as each day brings a new revelation, our 'illegitimate' president is trying to tell more BS to the rest of the American people who've already seen ample examples of what 'hogwash' really means.

We Americans on the left knew right away on hot day in June 2015 about what type of candidate this proclaimed 'birther' would be. 

But the rest of America didn't realize then what type of Mafia boss their future president would be. 

With the upcoming depositions by three of his 'confidants' Trump is going to taste what many mafia bosses like ""The Teflon Don"" John Gotti Jr, found out when his underboss Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano turned into a turncoat himself to implicate his boss in 1991 in New York. 

Trump better watch out since he is like one of those mob bosses with lots of underbosses like Michael Cohen et Al who grew up in the same neighborhood near Queens, New York where John Gotti Jr and Sammy the Bull grew up.

But what's so amazing is that as per the latest poll, 65% of the Americans are saying Trump is not an honest man. 

On the contrary only a few Republicans are saying otherwise.

So in this 'Opera of Demons', only one man can save America from a criminal president. And his name is Robert S. Mueller.",democrats,"Maybe the spirit of John McCain will free 'We the People' from a devil called Trump. Hope the better Angels will shine a light against this ""Opera of Demons"" that Trump and his leeches are playing right now in our courtrooms."

"In ""John McCain, a scarred but Happy Warrior"", the editors of NYT has given a very glowing picture of a man who was a 'war hero' first.
 
Next John McCain was a terrific statesman who won many of our hearts on the left by voting against gutting the Obamacare and replacing with a terrible 'Trumpcare' bill infuriating Trump and his own Republican stalwarts.

So now since he died after battling a long and protracted brain cancer at age 81, we find something that never happened in the history of this great country. A sitting president is not invited to attend the funeral of 'the Maverick' of a man called Senator John McCain.

Why ?

Only because of Trump's loud and ugly mouth which denounced the heroics of a war hero by saying "" I don't care for soldiers who're captured. Period !""

With that very stupid and unpatriotic statement Trump might've secured his nomination through the votes of his equally moronic supporters but he lost a huge battle in the hearts of majority of the Americans like us who still consider John McCain as one of our most respected and true war heroes.

Although it is true that a young 25 year old John McCain's plane got shot down over the river in Vietnam with the artillery battery provided by Russia but what separates Senator McCain from millions of American war heroes is his refusal to walk out of those torturous Vietcong prisons run by nothing but total barbarians and nomads.

Yes, it was his refusal to leave his fellow U.S. prisoners behind that scarred his body and soul for almost 60 years from inhuman physical tortures inflicted upon him by those Devil's followers. 

We also know that he was tortured more for his refusal to leave that hellhole early because those guerrilla soldiers thought they couldn't get their comrades back because of him.

We all heard the story that captured Vietcong soldiers in our care were supposed to be released by the U.S. military in exchange for McCain's release from the jungle tent of Vietnam where all our great soldiers were kept. 

We should also never forget that in those jungle prisons where Senator McCain was kept, our other great POWs were whipped and slashed while in captivity. And not to forget that their body parts were sliced open like cattle.

There are recorded evidence that those animal like Vietcong guerrillas did the same thing to U.S. soldier prisoners what they did to their bullocks and pigs. Those barbarians used to chop those animals alive for their meals.

So for Trump to dehumanize a man who gave a major part of his life for America, is totally inhuman.

As we all know Senator McCain, he'll pardon Trump from heaven but we as true Americans shouldn't.",democrats,"Trump should say sorry to Senator McCain's soul for dehumanizing our war hero while he was alive.

"In ""How Far America Has Fallen"" in today's NYT, Roger Cohen, the famous Op-Ed writer has literally labeled Trump's die-hard supporters as so pathetic sycophants that they'd do anything to turn America's values upside down.

Mr. Cohen also told us ""The thing with every shocking revelation about Trump is that it's already baked into his image. I've never met a Trump supporter who did not know exactly who he is.""

In fact throughout his tour in America Mr. Cohen met so many different personalities like this pastor Robert Babcox in Grand Junction, Colorado who called Trump the true champion of Second Amendment Rights and he wants no one other than his favorite president Trump in the White House.

Mr. Cohen also found out that all of Trump's supporters want to keep America free of immigrants no matter at what cost.

In fact we've seen this picture of these type of White Americans trying to amuse themselves by beating up the foreigners coming to work here for almost free like the Chinese nationals who came in the Gold Rush era in the Sierra Madre Mountains of California in the beginning of 1800 and in later years. 

Those Chinese citizens bore the brunt of below zero temperatures first. 

Then they were the only ones who laid the first railroad tracks in the United States. 

As we've been told by our history books that the same Chinese labors who worked so hard to make transportation easier for their white American masters were brutally tortured and murdered for the fun of it by the drunken Trump like White Americans panning for gold in the rivers nearby. 

No wonder already poor Chinese laborers used to sleep in the cold mountain caves or on the railroad tracks they were laying to protect themselves from the marauding hard drinking White Americans like majority of Trump's supporters are.

Those racist Americans just like modern day Trump supporters used to shoot the Chinese railroad workers if they didn't find any wild boars to shoot, kill and cook for dinners. 

We also know that those Chinese people never got their recognition by way of residency or citizenship in America due to the totally xenophobic Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which forbade them from owning any property or doing anything that other White citizens could do. 

In other words the congress and president Chester A. Arthur told them on May 6,1882 that ""You can stay and do the hard labored jobs that we Americans do not like to do. But stay indoors after your work is finished. We do not like to see your faces when we go outside unless you want to be killed or your asses deported back to China. Understand ?""

Trump and his supporters are literally telling the 'undocumented workers' of our time the same thing, ""Just do the work we White Americans do not want to do and then go back to your country. 
And if you don't go back we'll frame you for the murders that our modern day plantation owners commit for fun.""

Trump and the Republicans are literally sending a message to the 'undocumented workers' of our time, ""If you do not do what we tell you to do, we'll frame you for murders like one of your 'illegal alien' from Mexico got framed in Iowa. Our police will not look for the real killers because they're our Republican party officials who probably raped and murdered Mollie Tibbetts and dumped her body in a corn field where this Mexican guy worked.""

Trump and his supporters are knowingly demonizing all the immigrants .

We presume that Trump knows that most probably the Iowa police arrested the illegal farm worker for a murder his employers committed. Trump probably knows too that these ranchers employed this immigrant from Mexico with full knowledge that their slave has a fake social security number. 

They're now blaming the Democrats for political gain saying ,""The Democrats are for open borders which only leads to rape and murders of our White citizens.""

They're doing all that probably knowing fully well that a Republican modern day slave master sent his 'undocumented worker' to pick up the dead body of Ms. Tibbetts from the corn field. They probably were quite aware that ""an undocumented Mexican has more chance of being implicated for the murder of a White American girl than his  White boss.""

That is the reason why I hope the family of Mollie Tibbetts should request for a thorough investigation by F.B.I. agents rather than a possible bogus investigation by the local or Republican state controlled police dept.of Iowa.
",democrats,"The way Trump and Republicans are exploiting the killing of Mollie Tibbetts, if we don't call them racist bastards,we'll do injustice to the term written in the dictionary to describe Americans like them who hate others on the basis of the color of their skin,their cultures and nationalities."

If Democrats get the house they won't touch Trump untill well after Mueller's report. They want to drag it out as far as possible so as to damage the Republicans chances in 2020. The less time Pence has in office the better because if he becomes the President he could get the nod to take the nomination.

Sometime in September, Trump will be proven to have an illegitimate child with a former housekeeper. Nobody will care on either side. That's how crazy things are.",democrats,We are definitely on a path to the end.

"In ""The Tax-Cut Con Goes On"" by Paul Krugman in today's NYT, the famous economist and Op-Ed writer has given the Americans a very dire warning by also saying in his piece ""Why Social Security and Medicare are on the ballot"" this year if the Democrats, the Liberals, the Progressives and Bernie Sanders Independents fail to secure the congress next year. 

Just like Dr. Krugman, I also said before in one of my blogs in Reddit and elsewhere that the Devil couldn't have written the script for our Armageddon better than what Trump and the Republicans are writing together with ""one hand licking up the other"" scenario.

The Republican party, which has come a long way from their founders' ideals, is now totally engaged in nailing their coffin shut in their own paid graveyard with the sign on their tombstone clearly written for the world to see : ""R.I.P. : R.N.C.

HERE RESTS THE SOUL OF THE GRAND OLD PARTY.""

Also written underneath will be a sign saying, ""From now on please send all your inquiries at Trump Tower addressed to our president  Donald J. Trump. Please also note that Mr. Trump is our new owner/sole proprietor and our tax accountant."" 

Be assured Americans that there will be another sign underneath the same engraving in the same tombstone written in bold letters that will proclaim this : 

""OUR REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM NOW ON WILL BE KNOWN AS TRUMP PARTY. 

PLEASE WISH US LUCK IN OUR NEW ADVENTURE UNDER MR. TRUMP AND HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY. 

THE OLD PARTY FORMERLY KNOWN AS G.O.P. HAS DIED ON JANUARY 20TH, 2017. AND PERMANENTLY RESTING SIX FEET UNDER THIS GRAVE WITH NO INTENTION OF EVER COMING BACK TO LIFE .

GOD BLESS AMERICA.""

Well my fellow Americans, this is not a midsummer's dream. This idea that I spelled above is quite a possibility. The Republican party as we all know is really dead. 

And a new party has sprouted it's head within the same G.O.P. with Trump in total control of the rest of the Republicans.

Since it's not a mystery anymore that Trump is molding his adopted party in his own Trumpian way by threats of violence first.

Next he's using utmost blackmail tactics to keep the Republican congress members under his command like Jim Jones did in Guyana in the '80s by unleashing his attack dogs in the form of White Supremacists/ Nationalists and David Duke of KKK .
