"We are two of r/democrats more vocal members from opposite sides of the aisle. /u/Caveliertunes speaks out for Progressives and I, /u/backpackwayne, encourage the more Centrist view. We both have our arguments, and we both do our best to convince others of our position. But with exactly two months until a crucial election, we have decided to join together and urge unity, if only for a short time. 
 The following are statements are from each of us and we only ask that you listen.


-----------------


**From /u/backpackwayne:**

The Democratic Party has been in a struggle for control for over two years now, and this battle has taken its toll. Republicans are giddy as we are doing their job for them. Progressives and Centrists want the same things but differ on how to achieve them. But we do want the same things. Putting that aside, it is time to look at reality. If democrats do not win back the house and/or the senate in this election, we will face another two years of our democracy being shredded by an inept and callous Trump administration. They will stack the courts, take away our rights, abuse and pollute our justice system, destroy our environment, and eliminate any chance for universal healthcare for at least a decade.

The fight for the left should take place in the primaries. **THE PRIMARIES ARE NOW OVER!**  In the next two months we must unite and fight for the candidates that have been chosen. If we don’t, it won’t matter who controls the left. We can get back to that battle later after the election. It is imperative that we put aside our differences for the time being and stop fighting with each other. We all know who the real threat to our democracy is. So please stop this infighting and join together to achieve step one our both our goals. We need to first stop the bleeding and prevent any further damage by gaining control of at least one chamber of Congress. As a united front, there is no stopping us. Divided we face the worst threat to our democracy in yours and my lifetime.

-----------------


**From /u/Caveliertunes:**

Understandably, there are still many hurt feelings and resentment left over from 2016. We all understand. Many Progressives feel unwelcome and belittled. Many Centrists feel like they are consistently under attack. If you feel like your fellow Democrats who are of an alternative viewpoint are not respecting you, remember they likely feel the same way. Empathy is an important trait to have right now. It is something we have over the Republican Party; it is something we need to utilize—not only to defeat them but to work together. We, as a party, must be able to combine our efforts if we are to achieve any of our goals. Perhaps it is ironic that the man who said it best was a Republican himself, Abraham Lincoln: ""A house divided against itself, cannot stand.""

We may not ever all completely agree, but that is what makes us great. That is what makes us strong and resilient! As many have often said: we are a ""big tent party."" We can disagree; we can like different politicians; we can debate about the issues. However, we cannot waver: **Not now!** 

**THE PRIMARIES ARE NOW OVER.** Progressives and Centrists both had significant victories in the primaries this year, and it is becoming increasingly evident that both sides have a place in the Democratic Party. We all have a voice, and those voices are heard loud and clear. However, once the primaries end, we need to put aside any lingering resentment and work toward achieving our common goal. We've all decided that the Republican Party is dangerous! Even if we can't get everything we want out of the election, we can at least achieve that shared objective.

Progressivism is necessary to push forward toward ideals we must achieve as a nation. Centrism is essential to moderate, balance, and work pragmatically when needed, so we don't fizzle out before the fight begins. We are sides of the same coin. We are all necessary for a complete and robust Democratic Party. Progressives and Centrists are both the ""base"" of the party: We need one another! Let's make sure we find ourselves in a position where we can affect policy and help both the party and the country grow!

Respect one another. Respect each other's points of view and preferences. Let's show a united front now and in November, and grind out our differences after the election.

"In his Op-Ed piece called ""The Commander of Fear"" Charles M . Blow has taken Trump to the task with another sentence saying, ""Trump's magical mixture is to make being afraid feel like fun.""

To show my appreciation for Mr. Blow's column, I like to add my line saying this : We democrats have no illusion that Trump could only run with a Republican ticket in 2016. 

Why ?

Because we on the left would've given him no ground to start his campaign with the most divisive language like, ""Mexicans are bringing....."" like Charles mentioned in his Op-Ed.

Actually if fear could be used as a weapon then the Republican party was guilty of always welcoming all of their candidates whoever had fear mongering messages. And they did it for a very long time. 

No wonder Trump took full advantage of a ready made audience that the Republicans had nurtured for a almost a century.

He came up with some of the most outlandish claims that any other Americans had ever come up with. 

By announcing Obama's presidency illegal, Trump started spreading this rumor that our first Black president was not born in America but in his father's native land Kenya.

Almost all the Republicans jumped on the same hoax spread by Trump saying in unison that ""if Obama was not born here, he could not be president of this country.""

What nobody told Trump on his ugly face was, ""So what ?""

With his White Kansas born American mother, Obama had as much claim to the throne as John McCain who was born on Panamanian waters as we've seen in his birth certificate issued by a hospital in Panama. 

But none of that was a concern for the morons who filled up the higher echelons of G.O.P. 

So with ""Here it goes again"" sounding all over the country with ""The Commander OF Fear"" as Mr. Blow addressed him in his piece, Trump and his leeches are spreading one fear after another squashing all the civility that this country grew up with. 

Trump's sponsored candidate DeSantis of Florida went one step further by insinuating while using a bull horn on Fox Tv that his Black opponent for Governor, ""is a Monkey"".

Go figure !",democrats,"Trump will burn in hell for spreading one fear mongering counterpoint after another using many bullhorns with totally racist undertones. Even DeSantis, his sponsored Republican candidate in Florida Governor's race used the word ""Monkey' to describe his Black opponent."

"As Dr. Thomas L. Friedman rightly said in his Op-Ed today in NYT, ""What if Trump Did Actually Shoot Someone on Fifth Avenue ?"" where the famous columnist has cautioned us on the left warning us saying ""Your vote in the midterms matters, because republicans in Congress won't restrain the president's excesses.""

Actually this type of warnings came to us two days in a row by two different gentlemen who really care about America, by Paul Krugman yesterday. And Dr. Friedman today.

But it's the Evangelicals who're still supporting Trump even after their meeting with their president day before yesterday who  should be really fearful of their fate. Those pastors and their congregation should realize that by supporting a pure evil called Trump they're praying to the Devil, not Jesus.

Being associated with the Devil himself or an incarnation of Lucifer called Trump, those Christian leaders and their congregation should be ashamed of calling themselves Christians.

Those apostles have to realize that they're in cahoot with a man who said in his campaign stops that his supporters would still vote for him even if he ""shot someone on the Fifth Avenue"" the subject of the Op-Ed in NYT today.

Although Dr. Friedman's column is fictional but Trump has such a sway over his followers in the Republican Party who'll look the other way even if Trump shoots someone totally unprovoked on Fifth Avenue in New York or on Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington D.C.

Even the Senators like Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul are ready to trash their colleague and best friend John McCain's legacy and his wishes of calling Russia's president Putin, ""a thug"" even a few days before his death from brain cancer.

As no one knows yet how much help the Russians extended to both of the above Republican Senator's reelection campaigns, those two Senators and other stalwarts from G.O.P. sure like to overlook Russian intervention in our last election which catapulted not only Trump in the Oval office of White House. 

The Russians helped majority of the Republican congressional candidates to destroy their Democratic opponents' chances of winning elections by hacking and publishing their small infractions with the law like not paying their parking tickets years ago.

I cannot believe that Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and other senior members of the Republican party like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan do not have any clue about Russian intervention in our elections in 2016. The fact is, they know.

Or if they don't know they should ask Mr. Mueller. He knows what Russians did.",democrats,"Evangelicals,who're still supporting Trump even after their meeting with him where he said, ""There'll be violence after election"" should pray to Devil instead of Jesus.

"NY-23 has the opportunity to elect the first cyber security expert to congress. [Tracy Mitrano](https://tracymitranoforcongress.com/) is running against incumbent Tom Reed, a long time Trump supporter. Mitrano is the former director of information technology policy for Cornell University. She's running on a campaign of universal healthcare, net neutrality, and accessible higher education.

Currently NY-23 is rated as R +6 according to Cook voter index. Voters are apathetic about Tom Reed, and turnout is usually low. In the democratic primaries, more votes were cast than in any primary since the redistricting about 7 years ago.

This is a very winnable race. Congress desperately needs someone with experience in information technology and cyber security, especially as nature of election interference has begun moving into the digital age. The [videos of congress trying to ask Mark Zuckerberg questions about facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0) should be a red flag that our current congress is not prepared to handle these threats. Tracy Mitrano is one (if not the only) congressional candidate qualified to handle these kinds of hearings.

​

Locally, many big manufacturing plants have been shutting down. Thousands have lost their jobs in the last year alone. Pollution from a nuclear plant neat the great lakes remains a concern. Opioid addiction continues to rip through the community. Much of the land here is farm land, and will be hit by Trump tariffs.

Mitrano needs help. Reed is backed by multiple pharmaceutical companies, and several other big lobbying firms. She needs name recognition and much more media attention than local newspapers can give her.

​

If you can give money, time, or just words of encouragement the campaign can use it all. @ her campaign on twitter. Tag her in stories about election meddling and cyber security. Write post cards to voters. Donate a couple bucks. If you're in the area, join us going door to door. Buy signs and bumper stickers. Write in opinion pieces to local newspapers in the district.

​

With some help, this race can flip. It's marked ""safe R"" by most forecasts, but in this climate this one is an excellent bet for a surprise upset.",democrats,Tracy Mitrano - NY23

While appreciating Dr. Krugman's comments, I also like to put my own input on the subject by informing our Dem members of congress and Dem, Liberal, Progressive and Bernie's Independent voters that we're at the edge of a precipice if we don't take this upcoming midterms seriously.

I just like to remind our voters that there are still millions of Republican supporters who voted for Trump in 2016. These Trump voters voted for him not having any clue who they were voting for.

They just went to the poling booths to vote for a narcissistic sycophant who initially used dog whistle to question our first Black president Obama's place of birth to put him in the spot light.

Next, he literally blew a big trumpet to announce his candidacy for the presidency by using senseless jingoism and pointed attacks on the Mexicans in particular, immigrants in general.

And now as we're nearing two years of Trump's ascendancy to the throne once coveted by ideal Republican presidents like Abe Lincoln and Gen. David ""Ike"" Eisenhower and Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter and John Kennedy, we're almost at the edge of the Abyss where any mistake by our countrymen to put the same Republican party in power after November's midterms will put our country towards the dictatorship that we've only read in the Newspapers or watched on tv.

Yes, it's true that we've never seen a dictator in this great country which functioned as a Democracy for almost 300 hundred years. 

Hope we do not have to see now with Trump turning into a totally rogue dictator starting January 1st, 2019.

That is the only reason why this upcoming elections are so important for the existence of America and the prevalence of American values that were instilled on July 4th 1776.

We should not also forget our Constitution that was ratified on June 21,1788. And the 27+ Amendments which sealed the deal against an impending authoritarian regime that Trump is going to bring in if the Republicans are kept in power in both the chambers of congress after the midterms on November 6th.",democrats,"By not lowering the flag initially for late Sen.

,democrats,O’Rourke: Texas should lead the way on true criminal justice reform [Opinion]
"The subject of impeachment is one of, if not the, most debated issues for democrats heading into the midterms. For the purpose of argument, I'll assume the Democratic Party's primary goal is the removal of Trump from office as quickly as possible. 

The party leadership appears to have taken the position that I will define as strategic. They believe, based on Bill Clinton's experience, that a failed attempt at impeachment will backfire, prolonging Trump's term. Consequently, they are choosing to focus on convincing voters to vote for opponents of Trump which would both signal Trump's unpopularity and legitimate the threat of impeachment.

I believe a competing set of arguments exists which i will define as civic. This can be broadly summarized as the (correct) belief that Trump is a clear and present danger to the republic and congress should constrain the president in any manner necessary up to and including impeachment and reform and prosecuting and reforming political and bureaucratic institutions that knowingly behaved criminally during or leading to the Trump presidency. Those in the civic camp would argue that a congressional candidate that does recognize the existential threat of a Trump presidency and campaign on their desire to impeachment is neglecting their patriotic duty at the expense of partisanship.

I think we should try to find a compromise between these two groups that will get to impeachment fastest. I think voters want both strategists and civics. I think the democratic party and its candidates need to determine a way to identify themselves as pro-impeachment without undermining their positions through demonstrations of partisanship.

IMO politicians should work to convince their constituents that Trump is a clear and present threat to the republic from an objective basis. This should be treated like climate change. We have to work to prove incontrovertibly that Trump is currently doing irreparable damage to the United States and must be removed from office as soon as possible for the good of the country and the world.

"**PragerU's video about Immigration is the worst, poorly researched and stereotypical right view on Immigration. So I thought, with sources and ACTUAL research the REAL FACTS about Immigration.**  

The United States cannot dis-allow immigration. With a poor education system, H1B and EB visa holders are essential for growth (1). Even with STEM (which is still failing), the soft-nationalist view that Immigration is just ""unneeded space."" They gave the number of Immigrants to the US, and implied that they are useless. But in reality, not only are they productive and better workers, they CREATE jobs for the American people. This is true amongst the tech sector especially: with the Silicon Valley practically created by Immigrants and the H1B visa (2). Infact, the US economy is SUFFERING from restrictions on visas (3)! And while Trump claims an ""economic victory"" because the economy has hit the highest points in history (which is true, but unstable and not because of Trump), he needs to learn that immigrants are actually NEEDED to keep America ""great"".

"Charles M. Blow has given us a fantastic Op-Ed in today's NYT called ""Opera of Demons"". 

By using very intelligent analogy Mr. Blow told us what we wanted to hear. 

He said what we're witnessing right now all over the American is nothing but a devilish opera staged by Trump and his leeches.

Charles also told us that ""Trump has created a series of odd bedfellows.""

With the same Op-Ed, the writer has given us an up to date account of the strange drama being played out in our court rooms where one after another of Trump's confidantes are jumping in the pit after taking Mr. Mueller's bait to implicate their co-conspirator in a high crimes and misdemeanor scenario.

Some ugly Americans on Trump's side like Rudy Giuliani is trying to con the entire country by saying ""Truth isn't truth.""  He doesn't know that we know better.

But there is one good thing to this opera where some of the con artists have decided to switch their designated roles and implicate their president Trump. 

Adding to Charles's description of the ""Opera of Demons', I like to add that only if Trump ever read the red colored Bible his mother gave him at age ten, he could gain an important knowledge from an early age of his life, that is ""Every sin brings its own consequences.""

Being born in a racist family and leading a totally corrupted lifestyle in an opulent atmosphere, Trump bred into corruption himself.

A thoroughly racist Trump grew up in a house where his father Fred was always putting his own prejudiced views in his young son's head by always saying to a young Donald, ""Never show any compassion for the downtrodden"" which in Fred Trump's world meant only the minorities in general, Black folks in particular.

So here we've a man, who had said right after his inauguration,""I want to be the president of all the Americans"", is deliberately running the most divisive administration ever.

And as each day brings a new revelation, our 'illegitimate' president is trying to tell more BS to the rest of the American people who've already seen ample examples of what 'hogwash' really means.

We Americans on the left knew right away on hot day in June 2015 about what type of candidate this proclaimed 'birther' would be. 

But the rest of America didn't realize then what type of Mafia boss their future president would be. 

With the upcoming depositions by three of his 'confidants' Trump is going to taste what many mafia bosses like ""The Teflon Don"" John Gotti Jr, found out when his underboss Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano turned into a turncoat himself to implicate his boss in 1991 in New York. 

Trump better watch out since he is like one of those mob bosses with lots of underbosses like Michael Cohen et Al who grew up in the same neighborhood near Queens, New York where John Gotti Jr and Sammy the Bull grew up.

But what's so amazing is that as per the latest poll, 65% of the Americans are saying Trump is not an honest man. 

On the contrary only a few Republicans are saying otherwise.

So in this 'Opera of Demons', only one man can save America from a criminal president. And his name is Robert S. Mueller.",democrats,"Maybe the spirit of John McCain will free 'We the People' from a devil called Trump. Hope the better Angels will shine a light against this ""Opera of Demons"" that Trump and his leeches are playing right now in our courtrooms."

"In ""John McCain, a scarred but Happy Warrior"", the editors of NYT has given a very glowing picture of a man who was a 'war hero' first.
 
Next John McCain was a terrific statesman who won many of our hearts on the left by voting against gutting the Obamacare and replacing with a terrible 'Trumpcare' bill infuriating Trump and his own Republican stalwarts.

So now since he died after battling a long and protracted brain cancer at age 81, we find something that never happened in the history of this great country. A sitting president is not invited to attend the funeral of 'the Maverick' of a man called Senator John McCain.

Why ?

Only because of Trump's loud and ugly mouth which denounced the heroics of a war hero by saying "" I don't care for soldiers who're captured. Period !""

With that very stupid and unpatriotic statement Trump might've secured his nomination through the votes of his equally moronic supporters but he lost a huge battle in the hearts of majority of the Americans like us who still consider John McCain as one of our most respected and true war heroes.

Although it is true that a young 25 year old John McCain's plane got shot down over the river in Vietnam with the artillery battery provided by Russia but what separates Senator McCain from millions of American war heroes is his refusal to walk out of those torturous Vietcong prisons run by nothing but total barbarians and nomads.

Yes, it was his refusal to leave his fellow U.S. prisoners behind that scarred his body and soul for almost 60 years from inhuman physical tortures inflicted upon him by those Devil's followers. 

We also know that he was tortured more for his refusal to leave that hellhole early because those guerrilla soldiers thought they couldn't get their comrades back because of him.

We all heard the story that captured Vietcong soldiers in our care were supposed to be released by the U.S. military in exchange for McCain's release from the jungle tent of Vietnam where all our great soldiers were kept. 

We should also never forget that in those jungle prisons where Senator McCain was kept, our other great POWs were whipped and slashed while in captivity. And not to forget that their body parts were sliced open like cattle.

There are recorded evidence that those animal like Vietcong guerrillas did the same thing to U.S. soldier prisoners what they did to their bullocks and pigs. Those barbarians used to chop those animals alive for their meals.

So for Trump to dehumanize a man who gave a major part of his life for America, is totally inhuman.

As we all know Senator McCain, he'll pardon Trump from heaven but we as true Americans shouldn't.",democrats,"Trump should say sorry to Senator McCain's soul for dehumanizing our war hero while he was alive.

"In ""How Far America Has Fallen"" in today's NYT, Roger Cohen, the famous Op-Ed writer has literally labeled Trump's die-hard supporters as so pathetic sycophants that they'd do anything to turn America's values upside down.

Mr. Cohen also told us ""The thing with every shocking revelation about Trump is that it's already baked into his image. I've never met a Trump supporter who did not know exactly who he is.""

In fact throughout his tour in America Mr. Cohen met so many different personalities like this pastor Robert Babcox in Grand Junction, Colorado who called Trump the true champion of Second Amendment Rights and he wants no one other than his favorite president Trump in the White House.

Mr. Cohen also found out that all of Trump's supporters want to keep America free of immigrants no matter at what cost.

In fact we've seen this picture of these type of White Americans trying to amuse themselves by beating up the foreigners coming to work here for almost free like the Chinese nationals who came in the Gold Rush era in the Sierra Madre Mountains of California in the beginning of 1800 and in later years. 

Those Chinese citizens bore the brunt of below zero temperatures first. 

Then they were the only ones who laid the first railroad tracks in the United States. 

As we've been told by our history books that the same Chinese labors who worked so hard to make transportation easier for their white American masters were brutally tortured and murdered for the fun of it by the drunken Trump like White Americans panning for gold in the rivers nearby. 

No wonder already poor Chinese laborers used to sleep in the cold mountain caves or on the railroad tracks they were laying to protect themselves from the marauding hard drinking White Americans like majority of Trump's supporters are.

Those racist Americans just like modern day Trump supporters used to shoot the Chinese railroad workers if they didn't find any wild boars to shoot, kill and cook for dinners. 

We also know that those Chinese people never got their recognition by way of residency or citizenship in America due to the totally xenophobic Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 which forbade them from owning any property or doing anything that other White citizens could do. 

In other words the congress and president Chester A. Arthur told them on May 6,1882 that ""You can stay and do the hard labored jobs that we Americans do not like to do. But stay indoors after your work is finished. We do not like to see your faces when we go outside unless you want to be killed or your asses deported back to China. Understand ?""

Trump and his supporters are literally telling the 'undocumented workers' of our time the same thing, ""Just do the work we White Americans do not want to do and then go back to your country. 
And if you don't go back we'll frame you for the murders that our modern day plantation owners commit for fun.""

Trump and the Republicans are literally sending a message to the 'undocumented workers' of our time, ""If you do not do what we tell you to do, we'll frame you for murders like one of your 'illegal alien' from Mexico got framed in Iowa. Our police will not look for the real killers because they're our Republican party officials who probably raped and murdered Mollie Tibbetts and dumped her body in a corn field where this Mexican guy worked.""

Trump and his supporters are knowingly demonizing all the immigrants .

We presume that Trump knows that most probably the Iowa police arrested the illegal farm worker for a murder his employers committed. Trump probably knows too that these ranchers employed this immigrant from Mexico with full knowledge that their slave has a fake social security number. 

They're now blaming the Democrats for political gain saying ,""The Democrats are for open borders which only leads to rape and murders of our White citizens.""

They're doing all that probably knowing fully well that a Republican modern day slave master sent his 'undocumented worker' to pick up the dead body of Ms. Tibbetts from the corn field. They probably were quite aware that ""an undocumented Mexican has more chance of being implicated for the murder of a White American girl than his  White boss.""

That is the reason why I hope the family of Mollie Tibbetts should request for a thorough investigation by F.B.I. agents rather than a possible bogus investigation by the local or Republican state controlled police dept.of Iowa.
",democrats,"The way Trump and Republicans are exploiting the killing of Mollie Tibbetts, if we don't call them racist bastards,we'll do injustice to the term written in the dictionary to describe Americans like them who hate others on the basis of the color of their skin,their cultures and nationalities."

The Republican party, which has come a long way from their founders' ideals, is now totally engaged in nailing their coffin shut in their own paid graveyard with the sign on their tombstone clearly written for the world to see : ""R.I.P. : R.N.C.

HERE RESTS THE SOUL OF THE GRAND OLD PARTY.""

Also written underneath will be a sign saying, ""From now on please send all your inquiries at Trump Tower addressed to our president  Donald J. Trump. Please also note that Mr. Trump is our new owner/sole proprietor and our tax accountant."" 

Be assured Americans that there will be another sign underneath the same engraving in the same tombstone written in bold letters that will proclaim this : 

""OUR REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM NOW ON WILL BE KNOWN AS TRUMP PARTY. 

PLEASE WISH US LUCK IN OUR NEW ADVENTURE UNDER MR. TRUMP AND HIS IMMEDIATE FAMILY. 

THE OLD PARTY FORMERLY KNOWN AS G.O.P. HAS DIED ON JANUARY 20TH, 2017. AND PERMANENTLY RESTING SIX FEET UNDER THIS GRAVE WITH NO INTENTION OF EVER COMING BACK TO LIFE .

GOD BLESS AMERICA.""

Well my fellow Americans, this is not a midsummer's dream. This idea that I spelled above is quite a possibility. The Republican party as we all know is really dead. 

And a new party has sprouted it's head within the same G.O.P. with Trump in total control of the rest of the Republicans.

Since it's not a mystery anymore that Trump is molding his adopted party in his own Trumpian way by threats of violence first.

Next he's using utmost blackmail tactics to keep the Republican congress members under his command like Jim Jones did in Guyana in the '80s by unleashing his attack dogs in the form of White Supremacists/ Nationalists and David Duke of KKK .

In appreciation of the above column I like to add my own submission to the Republicans in congress, ""Please, please, remove Trump right now and save your party.""

But like Mr. Blow, I like many other Democrats know for sure that the parasites that have infected the Republican party since Trump came to power causing an unique parasitical condition among the stalwarts of the party and among all the current Republican party members in congress and outside when they're afraid to raise their voices at Trump.

Those pathetic zombies cannot even move one of their fingers towards their destructive president and say, ""Mr. President, you've inflicted enough damage to our party. Please resign right now before our party is totally routed by the Democrats in November's midterms.""

Those highly concerned Republicans should also pen a letter to Trump and say ""Mr. President, you are the worst president that our party ever had. So if you resign right now we might've sliver of a hope that our Republican party will be able to keep some of the seats in congress and maybe, maybe able to save your behind from a possible impeachment that is sure to come under a Democrats led congress.""

But we all know that is a midsummer's dream because the Republicans are such shameless animals that no good Americans can expect anything good coming out of these bunch of Trump's ass kissers.

We can only dream that only if the Republicans were born with any spines, they could take back their party from a megalomaniac who threatens them directly or in subtle terms that he'd destroy any of the Republicans' political career if that congress member dared to oppose him .

No wonder the R.N.C. or G.O.P. is no longer functioning the way we all knew about the party that was started by some extraordinary Americans like Abe Lincoln and his fellow Republicans who founded the party on March 20,1854 till the assassination of their first president in 1865. 

But looking forward to the disintegration of a major political party at the hands of a sycophant called Trump who trashed the main political gain the Republicans earned under their 40th president Ronald Reagan who rightfully decided to treat the Soviet Union as his presidency's and his Republican party's main enemy. 

Almost every Republican presidents since Reagan tried to maintain the same 'cold war' strategy started by Reagan to tell the Russian leaders,""We're watching your every moves.  So don't even try to penetrate our country's stronger defensive capabilities or you'll be wiped out with our 11,000+ nuclear bombs.""

But then they got a candidate for president in 2015 called Trump who kept on saying on his campaign trails that he wanted to be friends with Putin's Russia. And lo and behold, he extended that friendship so far and so fast that he even kept on asking in open forums for Russia's help in beating his opponent Hillary.

And now when he got the presidency with totally unscrupulous and in treasonous way with the help of his bunch of crooks like Flynn, Manafort, Papadopoulos, Rick Gates and through his fixer/ lawyer Cohen's trickery,he wants to mold his adopted party in his own way hushing every Republicans' mouths with bribery and threats of violence or threats of making their opponents win in their primaries and midterm elections if they went any further in their pursuits to oppose their own president. 

No Wonder, Ex-G.O.P. controlled House Speaker John Boehner recently announced that his own Republican party is not existing anymore. He also said, ""The Republican party is taking a nap somewhere. That's why it should be called Trump Party from now on.""

Go figure !

"The problem with politics today is simple - people don't vote for candidates anymore.  They vote ***against*** candidates all the time, but a vote for a candidate is exceptionally rare.  The 2016 presidential election was the ultimate expression of that.  I personally don't know any Trump voters, but I know a lot of people who voted against Clinton.  Similarly, I don't know any Clinton supporters, but I and most of my closest friends voted against Trump.

It doesn't have to be this way.  Think - how many things from 1787 do we actually use?  Horse drawn carriages? Nope, cars now.  Sails?  Nope, diesel engines or nuclear power for many warships.  Winner take all elections? Why are we still using this???

Political inertia.

But even the most powerful force in the universe of politics can be overcome, and for the Republic to survive in the age of the Internet it must be.  Otherwise the tribalism enabled by the choose your own authority news services of the Internet will drive us apart.

Consensus voting (a.k.a. Instant Runoff Voting, a.k.a. Alternate Voting, a.k.a. Ranked Choice Ballot) is one possible answer. Maine adopted it in 2016, a lone light in the darkness of that election cycle.

# What is it?

Here's a video for those who like videos.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE)

For those who don't want to spend the time watching here's a quick summary - Voters rank the candidates instead of choosing just one. When the ballots are counted the count proceeds by rounds.  To win the election a candidate must have a true consensus majority (50% +1 among all ballots cast, hence the name) among all voters instead of a simple majority (Largest share among all shares, no matter how small). On the first round only the first choice on each ballot is considered. If no candidate has a majority then whichever candidate received the fewest votes is disqualified from the election and the ballots cast to that candidate are **transferred** to the 2nd preference of those votes. The wording is important - these people are not getting a second vote, instead their vote is being moved from a now disqualified choice to a qualified one. After this is done a check is made to see if any candidate has a consensus majority. If not this process repeats with the least popular candidate being thrown out each time until a consensus is reached or only one candidate remains.

Even more information is here: [http://www.fairvote.org/](http://www.fairvote.org/)

# What does it change?

The largest change of Consensus Voting is it removes the spoiler effect. Consider - in 1992 if Consensus Voting was in place for the Presidency, would Clinton have won?  Or would most (if not all) the Perot voters had Bush as a their second choice?  In 2000 wouldn't Gore almost certainly have been the 2nd choice of the Nader voters?  If the Republicans used a consensus primary in New Hampshire in most states could you imagine Trump getting any momentum what with most people voting against him in the crowded field?

This spoiler effect is the reason primaries are held. In consensus voting though a primary is an unnecessary step.  If the Democrats can field 3 candidates in an election - why not?  A lot of voters not showing up is fatigue what with election cycles running almost as long as election terms these days.

It also changes the environment for the politicians themselves.  Going negative is rarely productive in Consensus Voting because voters aren't encouraged to vote against a bogeyman. Freed from the tyranny of needing to make a strategic voting choice they can truly speak their mind on their ballot.  Using this system do you honestly think Trump or Clinton wins in a field that included Kasich, Sanders and Cruz?

The effect of lifting the negativity even goes out into the field.  So you see someone putting up a sign to support a candidate, but not your favorite.  Under the current system there's nothing to talk about. Under consensus voting you can still ask each other to support each others favorites on the 2nd choice spot of the ballot.  In other words, talk with one another, not scream.

Consensus voting does weaken the two major parties and makes 3rd and even 4th or 5th parties viable. If it was put in place both parties would likely split along the fault lines that have been in place for awhile now. But ultimately I think that would be for the best.  People might actually want to vote if they didn't have to come to the poll and make a choice of evils while holding their nose.

The similarity between Nixon's troubles with the law is so similar to our current illegitimate president that while Trump's troubles are becoming wider everyday, it is absolutely impossible not to think that Trump didn't read the book of the movie I mentioned or didn't see the movie with the same name starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman.

I bet he read the book and saw the movie and is trying to follow the book and that famous movie's scripts play by play.

Although it is true that Trump didn't send five burglars in the D.N.C. headquarters like Nixon sent at the Watergate hotel in 1971 to listen to what his opponent George McGovern was planning for the presidential election in '72. 

But Trump did something more sinister and treasonous by asking our country's enemy No. 1 Russia to penetrate into his opponent Hillary's computers to dig out all her campaign related emails.

Thanks to the indictments by Mr. Mueller of 12 hackers including Guccifer 2.0 working for Russia's G.R.U. which is a version of our C.I.A., the Russians did just that plus more and in coordination with Trump's crooks working in his campaign released Ms. Clinton's mundane personal emails to Wikileaks to dehumanize his competitor.

With two convictions against his crooks if the Republicans don't run to the White House like they did on August 9th, '74 and ask Trump to resign right now like Nixon did, then they can surely kiss their behind for a Republican controlled House and perhaps the Senate too after November's midterms.",democrats,"Michael Cohen's testimony proved what we already know that Trump will pay huge money to obstruct justice.

"In ""Reclaiming Patriotism for the Left"" Jefferson Cowie also said this in today's Op-Ed in NYT that "" Surrendering national pride to champions of a blood-and-soil vision abdicates the fight for the soul and meaning of the American project.""

In honor of Jeff's column I like to add that the vision of America that Trump and his ilk has painted all over the world is nothing but an apparition.

By having factories all over the world, mainly in China and other impoverished countries like his version of ""shithole countries"" called Haiti whose impoverished citizens are making his ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"" hats for a mere nickel and dime on an hourly rate basis, Trump is throwing the term ""robber baron"" right on our faces.

Not only that this modern day slave master similar to the pick pocket chief Fagin from Charles Dickens' novel ""Oliver Twist"", Trump is running slave industries in many of the impoverished countries of the world like Bangladesh where his slaves are making all the expensive merchandise for Trump Inc. giving our illegitimate president billions of dollars in clear profits.

While those poor modern day slaves are busting their chops in horrible conditions, their slavemaster sits in the White House doing nothing except writing crap to his twitter followers all night long and watching Fox Tv. till noon.

While we talk about him, we also have to mention what his slaves in China and other ""shithole "" countries are doing for Trump's family members.

Those slaves working in ramshackle factories in Myanmar and other countries in Africa make expensive apparels for his daughter Ivanka's personal business which she recently lied saying she's since discontinued but apparently didn't. 

And that makes Trump's family one of the richest families of the world, maybe more. 

But as we've all seen for almost three years that Trump is still using smoke and mirror like haze over his campaign stops even now which his ignorant and illiterate followers still cannot not parse between the falsehood and reality only because either they're just plain stupid or totally ignorant or both.

Being a former ""Reality Star"", Trump knew the power of vocal magic. And he uses it extensively throughout his campaign tours mainly in the heartlands where the average education levels of his devotees were elementary schools. Hence their income levels are still below poverty level as well.

No wonder a billionaire grandson of an illegal immigrant from pre-Nazi Germany dehumanized the current 'undocumented workers' telling his followers ""These Mexicans and other emigres are the reason why you White Americans have no jobs.""

By bringing the long lost nationalistic spirits, Trump created hubris and paranoia among his devotees who struggled in the poor counties in our country's countryside without any money to move into the cities.

And that was a god given boon for a horrendous inhuman who by instinct and by his pre-Nazi Germany's blood flowing in his veins speaks of deprivation of American values just like what Hitler used to say in his ""vaterland"" Germany in the '30s and '40s.

Trump being a two timing current leader still maintains his production lines in China and elsewhere, not in America.

That is the truth and not ""Truth is not Truth"" like what Giuliani portrays on tv . 

Yes, it is the real truth that Trump is making an ass out of all the Americans. And that's what our parties of the left should be telling to the American people before the upcoming midterms.

The Democrats, the Liberals and the Progressives have to tell the entire country that ""Trump is an impostor. And he doesn't love America. Not only that, he's a traitor too and should be tried like that after the midterms are over.""",democrats,"Just like what Mr. Brennan's lawsuit will portray that ""Trump is a traitor who loves Russia, not America"", our parties on the left have to tell the same truth and not Giuliani's ""Truth is not the Truth"" to the American people before the upcoming midterms."

If it's to tuck frump, no thanks I'm out. 

If it's cause it's a woman's turn, no thanks I'm out. 

If it's cause the rich are rich and I'm somehow that fact alone is a problem, no thanks I'm out. 

If it's because capitalism is bad and somehow we will magically be the first people in history to make socialism work.... No thanks I'm out. 

If it's anything other than real solid policy ideas that will help widen the middle class and shrink the lower class, or anything other than people actually willing to listen to the American people not just those that live on the coast...

Then no thanks I'm out. It'll just be more of the same.

I'm tired of the identity politics, I'm tired of the ""well the pendulum swung kinda a little one way so we better make sure it goes farther in the other direction!"" That's why we have Trump, why Italy has their version of Trump, why Hungary has a wall. Because when given an inch people took a mile, they sprinted left and completely and willfully alienated those on the right. They just convinced themselves that anyone who might be a conservative is definitely a racist, sexist, bigot, fascist, homophobe, and Islamophobe. It alienated people who would have otherwise been willing to create meaningful dialogue. (not all obv. But definitely some would have been willing to discuss.) It made normal people say ""screw this, maybe Donald Trump has a point?""

One side tried sprinting as absolutely far left as they could go, solely for the sake of going left without any regard to the consequences of their actions. Now, the other side is sprinting as far right as possible without any regard to the consequences of their actions.

We have white supremacists openly meeting in public, we have fascists pretending to be anti-fascist attacking pretty much anyone. We have a dumb shit trade war brewing that's going to do what all trade wars do and ruin the economy. And idk if this is a problem to anyone else but me, but WE HAVE FUCKING WHITE SUPREMACISTS JUST PRANCING AROUND MY FUCKING COUNTRY! Mine! I mean it's your country too, but I swore an oath to defend America from all enemies foreign and domestic and damnit I'll be right fucked if I sit by while supremacy reigns. You know how pissed I am that the left sprinted left so the dumbshit right sprinted right? I'm a white dude, and I despise with every fiber of my being supremacists in any form. And we have them in full force now, because of identity politics, because you can only call someone a racist and cry out that a group of people are racist for so long before they stop caring and actual racists show up. 

Why should we go left this time? Because of vaginas? Gay people? Because Drumpf is a racist?

We can all bet our money that our Russia helped president is not sleeping at all in the night.
With Twitter as his best friend, Trump is petrified about morning sun peeping through his bedroom window in the White House.

We can also bet that our illegitimate president Trump just wishes that the nights will stay longer so that he and his best friend in the form of his personal cellphone will do some inspirational work for millions of his twitter followers.

He also wishes that his new found friends in Fox Tv's morning show would wake up early and start their show at 2 AM instead of 7 in the morning so that their insomniac president can get some terrible advice on how to run his administration's foreign policies.

We all know by now that Trump formulates his immigration policies with the help of Sean Hannity and other pundits working in morning show of Fox Tv. 

That dependency on other ignorant advisers including Stephen Miller which dragged his reputation so far down with the majority of Americans that he might be ready to fire Stephen Miller, the main architect of his ill advised Muslim ban and the most degrading family separation policies.

This inhuman family separation policy that even Stephen's Jewish family members including his own uncle condemned after comparing his horrible practice to separate the parents of recent immigrants from their own children to that of Hitler's family separation practices of Jews and other prisoners at his concentration camps before they were gassed to death in '30s Germany.

No wonder now when the ghost of Nixon is making him wake up early from his bed at around maybe little after 12 o'clock in the night, Trump is contemplating to fight back against the apparent comparison of his presidency's end with Nixon.

We can all bet that he looks at the 'Marine One' from his Oval Room window and shudders to think that this helicopter will whisk him away very soon from the White House lawns for the last time like a Navy helicopter whisked Richard Milhous Nixon on August 9th, 1974.",democrats,"Trump probably is getting worried thinking that the Marine One helicopter that takes him to any places he wants, might whisk him away one of these days from the White House for the last time imitating Nixon's farewell ride on August 9th,'74."

"In ""The Slippery Slope of Complicity"" in today's NYT, Paul Krugman has painted a very damning picture of the current G.O.P.

To that I add that if the spirits of the Republicans could soar from their deathbeds like many people claimed to have seen their dying bodies from the ceilings of the hospitals while they were having complicated surgeries, then these near mortal G.O.P. members of the party founded by almost a flawless human being called Abe Lincoln, they could realize that they've come the wrong way as depicted in the ad of a cigarette we've seen for a long time saying ""You've come a Long Way, Baby"".

Incidentally that same ad of the famous 'Virginia Slims"" cigarettes long favored by women now comes with a warning, ""Smoking might cause your death from lung cancer.""

By being complicit with their 'compromat' president Trump who's now advancing the sentence ,""Collusion is not a crime"" from his earlier claim of ""I did not collude with the Russians"", President Abe's party is now known as ""Trump Party"" in many circles.

And with no touch of civil discourses among the modern Republicans under Trump's tutelage, G.O.P. lost its mojo that made them so popular among the majority of Americans in the later half of the nineteenth century and in most part of the twentieth century.

What the current Republicans have is a devilish will to win elections at any cost damning the original ideologies. Even the Russia hawks of their party like Lindsey Graham is now a big fan of Trumpian monologues.

MR. Graham's change of heart towards Trump and his Russian friends happened due to some sinister plot that are yet to be discovered by our current counter-intelligence officials with the help of all the retired C.I.A. and F.B.I. officials, like Mr. Brennan, Mr. Clapper, General Hayden, James Comey et Al. 

There is a rumor circulating among the ex-counter intelligence officials that Russia played a similar role in South Carolina's elections like in many other state's including Kentucky state's elections in '16 when Senator Graham and Rand Paul ran for the Senatorial elections.

It is widely presumed among many members of our parties of the left that Russian hackers helped Mr. Graham's Republican congress members in SC.

In the same fashion the Russians helped the candidates fighting for congressional elections in Senator Rand Paul's state of KY to elect as many Republicans as possible in that state including their current G.O.P. Governor Matt Bevin.

Russian hackers acted at the same time when they helped Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul's new found friend Trump in the presidential election. 

No wonder Paul Ryan wants to invite those Russian politburo members in our country, the same members who were sanctioned by our Govt.

That is the main reason why our congress must force Trump to return John Brennan's security clearance and not allow him to take away SC of any other current and former officials.
