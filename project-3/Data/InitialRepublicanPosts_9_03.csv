It does not stop there. She responded to it.


From Julia,
&gt; Hi Stephen. I do not personally manage my website. I explained in my statement yesterday that a staffer who wrote the language in one platform page (written in first-person) mistakenly said this. I asked that it be corrected as soon as I was alerted to it yesterday morning.

https://twitter.com/JuliaCarmel__/status/1033376472529031168



The problem is there is a video of her saying she is an immigrant.

What is currently defined as hispanic, includes people from all races whose only common trait in most cases is that they speak Spanish. They dont eat the same food, listen the same music or share a common history. A Mexican and a Cuban are as miles apart culturally. Even a Mexican and a Salvadorian which share a more similar background can barely stand each other.

Hello fellow Republicans! I am a Republican who loves debate. However, if you look at rule 1, debate is not allowed. I am not complaining about this, as debate would encourage trolling from your opposition all over this sub. However, if any of you guys are interested in debating your beliefs with people who have opposing viewpoints in an environment where everyone is required to be respectful, please consider partaking in discussions on my new [subreddit](https://new.reddit.com/r/Debatocratics/). If you wish to gather a group of like-minded people within your community before heading over, please feel free to do so.
