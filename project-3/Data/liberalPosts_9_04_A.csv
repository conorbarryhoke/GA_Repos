"I keep thinking about what can I do to do some good in this world and make some positive change. I have a friend who managed to make an amazing impact by creating soccer in the streets in Atlanta. He gets kids (minorities and poor socio economic background) free and local soccer training by getting a soccer field on the roof of a local busy train station. https://www.soccerstreets.org

This has a lot of great results and he is doing a really positive impact. 

This got me thinking, what can I do to help the world? I can’t play soccer and I live in the border of a very rural area in Georgia. 

I’m an immigrant, work in tech in a big company, work from home, make a pretty decent living, own my house, and all in all living the American dream. But every time I go to Walmart, Target, Starbucks, a local iHop, I keep seeing more and more cases of people that should be in retirement age but still work as they lost their pension in the 2008 financial crisis. I own an investment home in a more rural area, and my tenants seem to be living paycheck to paycheck. 

I decided to learn more about the life in rural America, that place where the so called Trump core lives, where you only see a lot of pickup trucks, guns, tattoos, teen moms, conspiracy theorists, confederate flags and a predominantly white population. 

The real picture of course is not the cliche above, every time I talk to someone when I travel north, to places with population 200 and 30-40% living in poverty, and a median household income of $20,000 or less, when looking through the stereotypes I find genuine warm people who are just fed up with everything. Some don’t even believe Trump would be able to change everything but for them it’s a big up yours to the elites. Can’t beat them, let’s piss them off. And trump pisses us off. The post fact era needs to be looked at in a different way. It’s not just choosing to believe trump and fox and friend because you are stupid, it’s because other outlets are calling you stupid. It’s a matter of stolen pride, of feeling defeated. There is no logic here. It’s a big FU to the rest of us. This is why Trump won even though all the things that in any normal campaign would end a candidates political career forever. He was the only one who made them feel good about themselves and what they believe in. It doesn’t matter if 100% of his policy is actually hurting them. It’s a matter of lost pride. He is telling them they are right, that the coal jobs got lost due to stupid climate change nonsense form China, and they want to believe, he says they lost their jobs due to Mexicans and they want to believe because it’s taking away the pain from the thought that there is no one to blame but the greedy financial institutions. 

Like any person they want a roof on their head, food, a sense of purpose, hope, a sense of belonging and pride. 

Trump gives them that. 

But we can give them that too, the forgotten people that trump hugged repaid him by listening to and buying his (many times easily proven) false claims. 
People believe to people they like. Facts alone don’t really help as people believe to what they want to believe and they will find evidence to support it just to feel good about themselves.

So here is my plan. I want to help the forgotten man and women of America with not just empty promises of a wall, or getting back coal mines to work. I want to help them adopt the changing economy and skill set. I want to help them as I think that no one really cares about them. We see them as a bunch of racist, science haters, Fox News watchers, religious fanatic losers that blame their problems on the wrong things. Many people look down on them. And they have no empathy, they are mostly white, not a monitory, not immigrants, they get no empathy from almost no one. But if I can generalize something as vague as “rural America”, regardless of race or religion, I won’t be needing a lot persuasion to claim they are one of the poorest demographic in the country. 

So what do I suggest? Volunteering in rural America. I am pretty sure that if I offer a free or symbolic STEM camp after school in a poor southern SomethingVille with pop 300 and only a local hospital as the main employer with 90% trump voters, 60% high school grad rate and median income of 15k, I will be flooded in signups. 

Kids learn science in school I assume in any public school but adding more fun after school STEM activities from someone with some different views can definitely help. Teaching kids about science which includes learning researching on their own, looking and several views, fact based debating, in a fun way can make a difference.

Another volunteer program I plan is teaching young adults who are interested in a career change to more modern skill sets. I can teach IT skills that don’t need a bachelor degree. Most bootcamp programs are in the big cities and many are not aware or believe they can get into IT. I can teach programming, cloud, cyber security, and even AI and machine learning. I can get people prepared to online bootcamps, interview prep, finding outsourced work etc. there is a $4000 bachelor degree from university of the people I can help people prepare to and go through, and represent them and help them negotiate a job. It’s not for everyone but at least I can help a few that don’t know they have the talent for it to get a completely new career they never thought they will be great at. 

Alone I can’t make a nation wide impact but with help from others this, with time, can make a real difference. It will make the change from within.

"Yesterday, despite justice being served to Manafort and Cohen , was one of the most upsetting news days I have seen in a while. As some of you may know , a missing college student in Iowa was found dead, and was murdered by an undocumented immigrant. She was a friend of a friend who attends the same college as her , so this hit me especially hard. This was a young woman who had nothing but warmth and love to give, literally the type of girl Tom petty songs are about. And within hours of this heartbreaking news emerging, our commander in chief brought her up at a rally in W.V. and used this tragedy to justify a border wall. Mollie was a fucking democrat and now , when she can’t speak out, Trump fox ect are using her for their own gain. I usually have very thick skin but this fucking broke me. 

A real commander in chief would be a healer and a leader in taking action to protect Americans . Trump used a horrific event to pull us as a country further apart along political and racial lines. This and trumps other hateful and divisive remarks are why we need to organize and vote before he does any more lasting damage to the social fabric of our country. Fox News joining in on this and using this tragedy to distract from earth shaking legal developments with Cohen and Manafort didn’t help either. 

This is not normal. 

This is not ok.

This is not what America is, has , or will be. 

We should be able to have reasonable and informed debate over immigration laws without full on fear mongering. I’m a democrat but we need to have laws so that people don’t get fucking murdered. 


We need to make sure we never ever again let our politics become so toxic and tribal that we can’t be torn apart by a cancer like trump again. Every second this prick spends trolling us is a second that problems in this country are not being solved. That’s the stakes here, this shit is very very real. 


Have a reverence for how real and sick what trump is doing is.

"Now, before I say anything, I would like to put out that I am not liberal, however I do live by many religious statutes, one being from the book of Romans, saying ""as far as it depends upon you, be at peace with all people"". Given this, I do not mean to offend anyone here, and this is actually a legitimate question. So today, I see one big problem in society that really makes me mad, and that is that if two people don't agree with each other, they can't still get along. Not only will they not be the best of friends, but one person will generally keep arguing their side even when it's not at all related to the subject at hand, and also regardless of whether or not they have good points. For example, I was talking with my friend one day about some light political stuff, and the topic of Trump's presidency came up. And I stated that I generally support his presidency, and left it at that. Now she obviously didn't because she kept bringing up reasons why he was a terrible person. I quickly respond with the fact that I don't support him because I think he's a good person, but because he's been fairly effective while in office (i.e. negotiations with Korea). Now she still continued to nag, and even started to put me down personally. So, back to the question part. I see that generally the people who actually like this are liberal, and im asking if that's what all of you are like, or if that's just the few I see in my life.",Liberal,I have a question

"East Coast (and frankly, Midwestern too) liberalism is more traditionally Democratic, more machine politics-focused, more supportive of unions, New Deal programs, etc, and perhaps less supportive of things like environmentalism. East Coast liberals are perhaps a bit more pragmatic and less idealistic than West Coast liberals. 

West Coast liberalism is often quite secular, ideological, and less tied to the Democratic Party (that is, more supportive of liberal third-parties or just being Independent).  There's greater emphasis on environmentalism and cultural issues like abortion and gay rights. There is probably a bit more of a laissez-faire, ""libertarian"" attitude socially on the West Coast, as well as less affinity for  traditional Democratic economic and social programs than the East Coast.",Liberal,How accurate is this assessment of West Coast vs east Coast liberalism?

"Hi friends, I’m here to learn and not to start WWIII. I just had a few questions and I’d love to hear from those on the other side of the aisle. To give a summary of who I am and my beliefs, I’m a half White, half Hispanic libertarian-conservative. I believe that a small government gives people the most freedom and through that freedom, we can all thrive. I’m also Catholic, so I believe in traditional marriage BUT I do believe gay marriage should be legal. I’m also pro life and believe life should be protected from conception until natural death. I’m a big supporter of clean energy and the environment. I’m also a 2nd Amendment supporter. I graduated from a University of California school with a degree in sociology so I’m pretty well versed in Marxist and more left leaning thinking. In fact studying those schools of thought made me solidify my conservative beliefs. I voted for President Trump and I like some of what he’s done and I hate others. I also HATE his twitter feed.... it drives me insane.

My questions:

1. A couple of decades ago liberals and conservatives were able to respectfully talk with one another, but sadly I do not see that happen much today. Do you think there’s a chance we can once again come together and talk politics? I’m a firm believer that the United States is like the Bald Eagle, it cannot fly without the left or the right wing. She needs both.

2. Do you believe that the mainstream media has some bias?

3. Do you read the Constitution as a textualist/originalist?

4. Why do you think the Democratic Party is supporting socialism more and more?

5. Do you have conservative friends and do you have respectful conversations with them?

6. Do you listen to conservative thinkers to gain insight on conservative thought? For example, Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, Mark Levin, Milton Friedman, or others?

7. Do you support the ever growing disdain for conservatives on US campuses? During my experiences at my university, and the countless videos and experiences I’ve seen/read about, it saddens me to see how much hate we receive.

8. Do you believe in some conservative views?

9. Can we be friends? A lot of my friends are liberal and I do value their opinions and I enjoy listening to their views. I honestly just want to be able to have these conversations without name-calling and spewing hate at one another.

"Laws are passed based on congressional majority. There are TWO parties capable of achieving this majority. These are (1) The Democrats and (2) The republicans.

Every state has its own priorities. West Virginians do not have the same worldview as Californians, for example. Political candidates in each state need to lean as politically left or right as they possibly can to win an election in that state. Just because you do not have your IDEAL candidate doesn't mean you lose sight of the greater good.

Right now, we have the republican party steadily heading on the path to fascism and white supremacy. They aren't acting as a check on the executive office. Whatever your disagreements on specific, mostly state focused positions of democratic candidates are, PLEASE don't be too self righteous and vote green or some third party. This serves NOTHING.

But about 99% of the conservatives I have talked to lack very basic conversational, listening, or even reading skills. It is IMPOSSIBLE to change their minds. Which tells you, either their beliefs are all flawless, or they are clearly too stubborn, and I think by examining their thinking habits tells you which of the two is more likely. Recently I was trying to explain to someone that while sea ice melting does not directly affect the rise in sea level, their melting corresponds to less reflective surface on the earth and so more sunlight is absorbed directly into our ocean which in turns increases the overall temperature, they would deny this as something ""lies from these researchers"" or that their degree in youtube browsing is somehow more credible than collective groups of scientist's degree and years of research.

Yet these people are so proud of themselves, they truly believe, with their lack of scientific knowledge and common sense that are symptoms of their lack of education, they are somehow ""superior"" to their liberal counter parts. They are unwilling to listen and have a civil discussion yet they brand liberals as radicals.

"So I've been thinking about creating something lately. Call me naive or whatnot. 

I think American democracy needs radical reform. And I think the way to accomplish reform is to create our own *alternative government*. This alternative government will first act as a nonprofit lobbying interest group, funneling money to preferred local candidates. Then the alternative government will slowly ""take over"" local governments, state governments, and finally the whole shebang. 

So what's so great about the ""alternative government""? What's the goal? It's purpose will be the realization of [*delegative democracy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy), or another purer, more robust form of democracy.  

IMO delegative democracy is the most impressive form I've read about. In the reality of day to day life, it's impossible for anybody to actively manage legislatures, judges, and bureaucrats. The vast majority of Americans do not have the time or desire to research dozens of political candidates to elect to dozens of political offices. As a result, our Democratic process is complete bullshit. Our government is out of control of the people, because the people do not know what is happening on the local, state, and federal level. The vast majority of people are unable to manage several dozen political positions, nor are they equipped to vote on budgetary issues. 

In other words, Democracy needs to be simplified. People have enough trouble choosing a single candidate. Well, why don't we just let them do just that? Just pick one person, anybody you want, to be your representative, your delegate. It could be your mom, or your boss, or a celebrity, or somebody in your social circle. It could be yourself. It could be someone you trust to make wise decisions on your behalf. Then your delegate could take on the responsibilities of politics, or he could then pass his and your choice along to somebody else. Hell, with the advent of computers and machine vision, we could even start *splitting* votes. Can't choose between two great candidates? Elect both of them. Don't want to give up all of your legislative voting power? Then split your choice. ""The average voter is stupid"". Well, is the average politician any smarter than the voter? 

So how can we realize this? I believe we must create an ""Alternative Government"" that fakes it until it makes it. 
The alternative government will begin as a political interest group composed of any US citizen who wants to join. Dues would be first collected on a voluntary basis and would be used to target local governments and ""convert"" them to a delegative democracy or alternative system. Dues will also be used on political research to better inform its members on who to vote for. 

Meanwhile, money will also be pumped into political candidates in proportion to the alternative government's voter choices. Lobbyists would be hired as the first proto-delegates. So the purpose of the interest group would be first to advocate for democracy, and then attempt to force the actual government to vote according to Democracy's desires. 

In the ideal, delegative democracy would be able to minimize the degrees of separation between the American people and their legislative representatives. I believe that Democracy has made good choices. I believe that if Democracy was working, we would have never had to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. 


TLDR: I have an idea. Do you think it could work? Is anybody interested in joining? ",Liberal,"A proposal to fix American politics on the Local, State, and Federal level. The formation of a new political group in advocacy of Democracy and Delegative Democracy."

"Conservatives are upset because, this young woman represents the answer to the failure of their ideology to provide for their society as a whole.  In fact, their ideology is nothing short of a rationalization for successful individuals avoiding having to consider themselves to any degree responsible for the overall society which has allowed them to thrive.  A woman critic of this new Liberal political star said, ""It would be very easy to believe that my children deserve healthcare and an education.""  She, I presume, does feel obligated to  provide her children those necessities. If she didn't, she would be very reasonably described as an unfit parent.  What she really is criticizing is the notion that she, as a member of society, should feel obligated to contribute to the provision of those necessities for other people's children.  The lie that has been at the basis of her self serving ideology is that holding individuals only accountable for themselves promotes responsibility in every individual to provide for the needs of the society as a whole in the most efficient and thereby beneficial way.  This is self-evidently not true.  It is benefitial to the society as a whole if its population is generally healthy and educated.  That can only be reasonably viewed adversely if the intent is to have or sustain a society in which one group is to be favored over another.  Fundamentally, this woman is saying she has a favored place in society and that society should sustain that even if doing that is detrimental to the society as a whole.",Liberal,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, A ""Democratic Socialist"""

"I honestly believe that the real reason so many Americans go for conservative candidates, time and again, instead of liberal ones, goes back to geography, and almost *solely* geography. America is an incredibly big country. In fact, it's almost ridiculous how gigantic it is. And the harsh truth about America being so big is that, a great deal of the people who live inside of it, tend to live *much further apart from one another* , than people in, for example, most EU countries.

I have hung out with more EUropeans in my life, at this point, than Americans, and most of my Euro friends, even if they're ""poor"", tend to feel like widely traveled people. They have seen cities all over Europe. Some of them, like my friends in Spain right near Portugal, are regularly crossing borders into other countries. Like it's nothing.

Compare this to my American friends, and the friends I know my parents had. I know people who live 30 minutes from NYC, in small Connecticut working towns, who are in their 40s and have never seen NYC a single time. Some ppl will find it preposterous. How could they never see it? The answer is simple: In a way, USA has no real mainstream train system like they do in Europe.  They don't have it, because they don't care about going to any cities all that much. Why not? Because what is so special about 9 out of 10 American cities? They are not Barcelona or Rome or Florence. In many an American mind, there is simply no reson to travel anywhere in this country. In fact, most dream vacations here will revolve around places far from any city: The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone Park, surfing on a secret beach in California. How often do you hear someone say ""I'll tell ya, i just really need to go to see Cincinatti."" For most of us, theres no reason. Its going to take another 900 years of the world spinning until Cincinatti will sound like Barcelona does now.

For many Americans, its a ""one time every 10 years thing"" to be aboard a train. This is really just not the case in Europe.  And this really brings up a much wider point, which is that Americans actually don't know other Americans all that well. HOw could they? They live far from them. Even the American urban centers are strangely impersonal and cold feeling, in comparison to what I've seen in liberal Euro land. Once you actually see Europe, it becomes very easy to understand why they're so liberal, and we are not.

I think its important that this is heavily stressed because so much crap gets talked about Americans, but, the truth is, they're just living by their particular geographical rules (and also their particular lack of, you know, thousands of years worth of history). In our own time now, its no secret, for example, that all the US cities are literally all blue. But these US cities still don't manage  to switch the culture completely, because the city still isn't quite the focal point of American culture, even when you're talking about pop culture. The European culture, in my experience, is almost entirely consumed by a heavily urban mindset. Museums, coffeeshops, day trips to other historical cities nearby. This is very important for them.

In the US, its simply not this prevalent. I grew up in a very troubled  Amreican city: Almost everyone wanted to leave it. That was the main dream. And most of them didn't want to leave for NYC -- that was interpreted as an even worse hell than where we came from. They wanted to move to the deep suburbs and live....far away from their neighbors. Because in America, the only thing a lot of neighbors ever seemed to mean, was that you were probably living in the projects, or in the middle of a place that was about to break out into a gang war. US cities look like they're the ones that got bombed in WW2, in comparison to the gleaming Euro centers. I don't blame anyone whose poor for wanting to escape them as soon as possible.

The American dream, thanks precisely to the nations geography and ""new world status"", is inherently tied up not with a sense of community -- but with a sense of escaping the community. So why, i ask, are so many people so surprised, by how hard it is, to get liberal ideas inside the US bloodstream? To me, it's sad, and i would indeed rather live the Euro liberal lifestyle--- but it's also not very surprising to me, when election after election in the US, inevitably goes conservative. So my real question i guess is, why do so many liberals here find it so unusually shocking?",Liberal,My Opinion On Why Liberalism Fails in USA

"I've been looking at recent polls, and seeing that Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders seem to be topping a lot of Democratic polling. For the life of me, I cannot understand why Democrats would want any of these three to win. First of all, the youngest among them, Warren, would be 72 at the time of her inauguration. It is clear that we need a fresher, younger face than any of these 3. I'll list the problems with them one by one, in my opinion.
Biden: Look, he was admittedly a pretty cool VP. He was quite good at going for the jugular and adopting an attacking stance in the debates, which is a key quality, but is he president material? I first of all worry that too many people consider Biden to be the cool VP, especially the younger generations. I am part of that younger generation (2020 will be the first election I'm able to vote in), but I worked on the Clinton campaign and with a Senator's office, as well as being a government major. I won't argue that I lived through may of the things you are, but I will say that I feel as though I've done some research, so don't dismiss me out of hand because I didn't fully understand the Obama administration's politics at the time. But getting back to Biden, I spoke with a good friend of mine and asked him why he thought Biden was a great candidate. This is an Ivy League student who attended one of the best public schools in America. His answer was: ""He's cool, he was a good VP."" I'm afraid that many people will adopt that strategy and believe he's a good president as well. But I think he fails the Democratic Party in a couple of ways. This is a man who is relatively conservative on an issue where Dems can really separate themselves, decriminalizing marijuana. He's also not anti-abortion, but doesn't support federal funding for it. These are two keys issues that Democrats like to talk about again and again, and yet once Biden runs, will they actually care? I hope so.
Sanders and Warren: Both of them are in somewhat the same vein, running as much more progressive candidates. While some of the things they say I really support, working for single payer healthcare, making education far more affordable, their views on the economy are shocking in some respects. A federal jobs guarantee was sponsored by both of them, which would offer a job to every person. This ignores everything that an economist will tell you, that its good to have some unemployment (I believe 3-3.5% is the threshold), because if too many people are employed, workers have too much power. This will drive up wages too much, which can then cause inflation. Sanders is also a supporter of guns. How can we as Democrats honestly choose to support a man who believes ""Gun control legislation should ultimately fall on individual states."" I'm not a single-issue voter, but this is just one of several red flags. Here is an interesting op-ed that goes into more detail on Warren's economic shortcomings: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/opinion/the-problem-with-elizabeth-warren.html.
With that little spiel in mind, I'll turn to who I like for the Democratic nomination in 2020. I will take into account both who is most likely to be successful running against Trump, as well as my own personal views on that person. I encourage people to disagree (respectfully) in the comments, and I am eager to learn if there are any outside candidates I haven't heard about (Please don't say Oprah, we don't need another celebrity).
Chris Murphy This pick leans a little more towards the ""I like this guy"", than that he will likely be elected. 47 was the age that Obama was elected however, so Murphy is not too young. I think his stance on gun control, including the 15 hour filibuster, was truly commendable. You can tell that he truly cares about the victims, and is truly attempting to curtail it. Murphy is a young, dynamic senator, who should check some of Democrats key boxes. Unfortunately, a white man is the most likely to win against Trump in 2020, I think. An interesting article
Sherrod Brown: Brown is perhaps the best choice for Democrats to reclaim their status as representing the white working class of America, which we saw Trump overwhelmingly win in 2016. As a senator in Ohio, he understands (while Hillary failed to), that at the end of the day the white workers often do prioritize economy over social issues. Now some of them might be profoundly racist, but a lot of their votes for Trump were centered around this idea that their taxes would be cut, and their jobs would be brought back. Brown has been shown to understand that, and has a good relationship with many working class people in his home state. He is both profoundly liberal while also catching the attention of the working class, which could be a winning combo. His fair trade, as opposed to free trade beliefs are a place where he seems to also separate from the general Democratic consensus, which is perhaps the one downside in my opinion.
Kamala Harris Harris has been a rising star in the Democratic Party, not because she's the next Obama, but because she's a principled, articulate, and passionate senator. She's been very progressive on some issues, but there are 2 reasons I have her out of the top spot. The first is that I find it hard to believe a half-black, half-indian woman will really be able to win this soon. I'm fully on board for Kamala 2024, I just worry that the uneducated whites will not at all vote more for Kamala than they did for Hillary (likely less), and the gain we would get from minorities wouldn't carry her to an election win anyway. The other is her questionable track record on crime. see. Not only has she defended in practice the California 3 strikes law, which is absurd, but although she claims to be anti-capital punishment she once asked the 9th Court to reverse their decision on stopping the Capital punishment. It's a pretty major issue where she ran more conservatively to her Republican opponent on when she ran for AG.
Another candidate that I like currently is Mitch Landrieu (although I haven't done too much research on him)
Now, some of you may be more progressive and saying that my concerns for Bernie/Warren are ill-founded. That's fine. I'm just eager to see who you believe, 2 years out should be the Democratic nominee. Hope you all respond and give your well-put answers for why I'm completely off track! Oh, and Vote Blue!",Liberal,Who would your top candidates for 2020 be?

"My father has watched Fox News as his primary news source for as long as I can remember, and honestly seeing it and all the lies they speak just pisses me off. He is a conservative and I rarely hear him talk about politics, but he constantly watches Fox when he is off from work. He is a very smart man but quite old school- think: struggles with many computer applications. I believe that the reasons he continues to watch Fox are: 

It is what he has always watched 

He does not know at all the magnitude of misinformation presented in the program 

How accessible it is to him, with it on basically 24/7

I want to dissuade him from watching it and maybe point him in a different direction. I have never really confronted him on this topic and he does not know my opinion on this. I am looking for any advice on how to tackle this issue. I believe if I presented him with sources that state just how misinformative Fox News is, he may sway from the program. Of course, these sources would need to be very credible as he has watched this program for a long time and hes not just going to switch over a little flack. If anyone has any good articles that discredit Fox News, they would be greatly appreciated.
I would also need to help to replace his news source with a more reputable one, which is just as challenging. He is a conservative man, and I don’t think he is going to become a liberal overnight so I am trying to find more conservative/centrist news outlets that are not straight lies. Just off the top of my head I am considering BBC or local news stations on TV, but I am very open to any suggestions. Sadly, I don’t think many online news sources will work with him because the man loves his TV and is shit on a computer.

"So people always argue that the United States should look to be like the Scandinavian Countries, who have embraced socialism and made themselves prosperous.

Today I am going to prove why this claim isn't true in two regards, one that Scandinavian countries are not socialist, and two, the socialist aspects of their country is only hurting them.

So many people are under the assumption that Scandinavian countries are socialist, and are able to enjoy many features such as free college and healthcare.

For today, I am going to use Denmark as an example, but you can look at the other countries if you like.

Socalist advocates, such as Bernie Sanders, argue that we should "" Tax the corporations and the rich more like Denmark to provide free college!!!""

However, a simply google search will show you that Denmarks corporate tax is considerably lower than the United States

This is Denmark's corporate tax:

[https://i.redd.it/ee92hocy55a11.png](https://i.redd.it/ee92hocy55a11.png)

This is the United States:

[https://i.redd.it/4ncja15065a11.png](https://i.redd.it/4ncja15065a11.png)

As you can see, there is almost a 15 percent difference between the corporate tax rates between Denmark and the US.

So where does the money for free college and healthcare come from?

The answer to that is YOU.

Denmark taxes its people at a rate of 60.2 percent.

Here is the proof:

[https://i.redd.it/9t7vhh0465a11.png](https://i.redd.it/9t7vhh0465a11.png)

And this personal income tax rate isn't just for the rich, this is for anyone who makes atleast 55k a year

That means if you make around 55k a year, the government will take 33k from you, leaving you with only 22k.

That leaves you under the poverty line in the United States, which is 27k a year.

Furthermore, Denmark and other Western European countries spend a pathetic amount on their defense budget, mainly because their military is funded and strengthened by the US.

Evidence for that is here:

[https://i.redd.it/01n5xd4765a11.png](https://i.redd.it/01n5xd4765a11.png)

As you can see, not even two months ago, Denmark had a pathetic 806 military personal on duty, because most of their defense comes from the US.

If the US was to pull out, they would have to spend considerably on their defense, not allowing for luxuries such as free college and healthcare.

Finally, in the long run, offering free college and healthcare, which in reality comes from insanely high tax rates, eventually strains the country because there is only so much money to run these programs for everyone.

This strain was already beginning to show as recently as 2017, and will only continue to grow, which ironically has led to people in Denmark demanding tax cuts.

Evidence for the strain is here:

[https://i.redd.it/esvi7k8a65a11.png](https://i.redd.it/esvi7k8a65a11.png)

And if you still believe that Denmark is truly socialist and not just capitalism mixed with a lot of unsustainable welfare, here is a quote from the former Denmark Prime Minister himself:

"It's entirely plausible at this point, if not likely, that Russia will interfere in the 2018 elections in ways even more brazen than the 2016 elections. They've seen nothing but massive benefits from their attack on our elections. It's also entirely plausible that this will happen to such an extent that it prevents Democrats from gaining control of either the House or the Senate, if not lose seats in both.  It's also entirely plausible, if not likely, that the Trump Administration/GOP will be complicit in this, if not actively aiding it, and at the very least will deny it/hide information/help cover it up. Trump would then fire Rosenstein in vindication, citing a mandate from the American people to put an end to the investigation, and install loyal servants into the top positions of the FBI/CIA/DOJ. 

I personally fail to see where the final failsafe is, aside from a Supreme Court to which Trump just nominated a second Justice who will surely protect him, and even if they can't, it's not looking promising that he would comply with any of the court's orders.

We're talking about a complete teardown of the principles and institutions of American Democracy, and in my mind it's all entirely within the realm of possibility, if not likely. Let that sink in.

"**Update** So I gave a somewhat ultimatum where I said that I am still his friend, tolerated his views, and maintained the agreement of not discussing politics while he did not and had provoked me on numerous occasions.  So given how patient I was with the way he disrespected me, I deserved an apology and an admission that he could have handled things better. 

&amp;nbsp;

He did agree, apologized, and admitted to his double-standards.  We then kinda went through a whole talk discussing his hypocrisy and his politics.  He admitted to his hypocrisy and told me how tough work is now because of his support for Trump.  He said he doesn't regret the vote, but Trump didn't do the things he promised, but still wants him to succeed. But he's not going to vote for him in 2020.

&amp;nbsp;

I then asked him to give me a list of reasons why he supports Trump and he couldn't.  He said that the way I questioned him angers him because I have a much better understanding of politics.  I told him that if he can't defend what he believes, then it's not worth defending, and that I just want him to have the facts in order to make an educated decision and not because I want to act superior. 

&amp;nbsp;

He told me that after Trump became president, that basically he's drifted away from politics and we agreed to not talk about politics again. He asked me to hold him to it and I said I would.  

&amp;nbsp;

I gave him one final recommendation in order to expand his knowledge of politics and at least see the other side of things and told him to watch the *""David Pakman Show""* which I believe to be one of the best political talk shows among the left sphere, and one that isn't emotional and has a very approachable layout.  He said he would look at it. 

&amp;nbsp;

We then talked about other things and said we should hangout again. 
&amp;nbsp;

It was certainly a difficult process, but forgiveness is something I believe in.  People make mistakes and change, and he was able to admit his wrong-doing and apologize.  Even though he's still ignorant of politics, he's aware of it.  I've seen documentaries of former Neo-Nazis and how they broke out of that mentality, and really it just takes compassion and not hatred. 

So yeah, happy ending. 

**End of Update** 


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


I know this is long, but there's a lot to say on the matter. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, this is the good old story about politics and friendship.
&amp;nbsp;

I knew my friend since I was in middle school and we've got a pretty close circle of friends that we drank and smoked till dawn with for years.  We've been through a lot of things and we've even worked together on an over-night shift, just the two of us, through the thick and thin of it all.  Ever since the election began, he came out as a Trump supporter and we all thought he was joking because that's the type of person he is.  He was very into the meme culture before it became synonymous with hate-speech and the alt-right. 

&amp;nbsp;


Down the line, it became obvious that my friend's support was serious and it was starting to split our circle of friends apart.  When I worked with him, we'd argue politics and there was a night where we had a very heated debate where I dropped facts and statistics and rebuked all of his positions.  I really tried to understand why he supported the things he did, but his answer to it all was *""leave me to my ignorance.""*  I'm not even kidding.  That didn't compute with me.  But even so, we agreed to not talk about politics near each other again.  
&amp;nbsp;

However, he still did or at least made remarks and political jokes in the store, and the store we worked at was basically Trump land, so that added to my nightmare.  He befriended a straight-up Neo-Nazi who advocated for Eugenics and some nihilist kid that just wanted to watch the world burn; that nihilist kid wasn't white, but he supported Trump, eugenics, and everything else.  It was very bizarre.  
&amp;nbsp;

So my friend constantly told me how he loved ""trolling"" to get a rise out of people and on facebook he would post his views and links to propaganda sites, so I constantly challenged his viewpoints.  He took me off for ""marauding"", which is really hypocritical, but he said that we were still friends and we were.  
&amp;nbsp;

We still drank and had fun, but our friend circle split and we slowly drifted apart, and because I didn't work at the same store as him anymore, we just didn't contact each other. 
&amp;nbsp;

I kinda understand why he voted for Trump, which is why I still reserve hope that he might reflect on his decision.  He has a very hard life and is unsatisfied with the world.  He has a kid, who's mother is a psycho and abusive bitch that doesn't hold a job and cheated on him, has a criminal record, yet holds custody over the kid.  He never finished high-school and holds 2 retail jobs.  
&amp;nbsp;

Ever since we drifted apart, I haven't talked to him for a year, but I kept thinking of the good old times and wanted to reconnect.  The last four years before the election were some of the best and most memorable. 
&amp;nbsp;

One of my other best-friends still keeps in touch, and earlier today he tried to rebuild our friendship.  He made a post about it on Facebook asking for us to make up.  The Trump-supporter friend said he still wants to be friends.

&amp;nbsp;

The dilemma is that even though I still want to be his friend, on principle I cannot accept his part in the election of such a horrible President, especially after I dispelled his views in a factual manner, without acting morally superior.  And honestly, I would have forgiven him maybe a week ago, but now with the Supreme Court Justice situation, it's like I don't know if I should forgive you.  You reap what you sow.  We're already seeing ramifications that will be multi-generational, and this is only the second year.  I would probably forgive him if he no longer supported Trump, but I have a feeling he still does. 

He's a nice guy, works hard, and helps his friends, and the only real negative thing I can say about him is his political ideology.  But if I had said the same thing about a Nazi, he would still be a Nazi that advocated for killing Jews.

&amp;nbsp;

Thomas Jefferson once said: *""I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.""*
&amp;nbsp;

However, even Jefferson didn't speak to John Adams for 12 years because of a political disagreement.  But their disagreement was a noble one, a disagreement about how involved a government should be. 
&amp;nbsp;

The disagreement I have with my friend is about the establishment of a near-fascist regime that is actively destroying civil liberties and the environment. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what would you recommend I do in this situation?  Should look past his ideology and accept the invitation to rekindle our friendship, or reject it?  If I do reject it, I would look bad to my other friend who initiated this attempt at a resolution. 

&amp;nbsp;

**TL:DR** One of my oldest and closest friends is a Trump supporter.  We stopped talking for over a year because of our disagreements.  My other friend wants us to rebuild our friendship and he said that he still considers me his friend.  I want to be his friend too, but because of my strong principles, I'm not sure if I can accept.

"just want to leave this comment here which i found:

&gt;In Austria you pay 7.74 % of your income for healthcare. 3.78 % the employee and 3.78% the employer.

&gt;This is part of the social security payments and those are capped if you earn more than 71,820.00 € a year. So nobody will ever pay more than 5,558.86 € a year for healthcare.

&gt;**The median working person in Austria pays 1,974.17 € a year for heathcare throug taxes.**

&gt;Also: Your country spent 1634 billion on Medicaid and Medicare in 2017. The USA has a population of 325.7 million. This means that **the avverage US Person pays already 5,016.88 $ a year for healthcare through taxes!**

&gt;https://budget.house.gov/budget-digest/fiscal-year-2018-budget-sustaining-medicare-medicaid/

&gt;So... **there isn't a single person who works in Austria who pays more for healthcare through taxes than a person who works in the USA.** And than you still have to buy private insurance (or your employer has to buy it for you which is essential the same). WTF. just WTF.

"Hi, conservative here.  Many liberals I know support higher taxes and more government power to help people and reign in corporate power.  I was wondering if your view of this has changed in light of the Trump Presidency. 

There's an arguement some make that go like this: 

Higher taxes means more money for the Trump administration to push forth their policies.  Greater power for the government means greater power for the Trump government to do things like impounding migrant children.  

Since there is always a possibility of people like Trump taking control of the government, would you agree that there should be limits on taxation and limits on state power to reign in the power of bad people who might take control of government? ",Liberal,Did the Trump Presidency cause you to change your mind on the limits of government
Wouldn't it be good if fewer people consider themselves as part of a political party? To me this practice seems to promote a kind of tribalism.

"Hi all, i was hoping to have a good faith discussion on the topic of universal health care (UHC) with a little twist on how its commonly discussed. 

Id like to take this as a learning opportunity for myself as to why people in favor of UHC think this idea would/wouldnt work.

Let me preface: im libertarian/conservative leaning BUT i have liberal friends whom I have good discussions with. 

So to the topic:

For those that are in favor of UHC, why not start a private, non govenment controlled program in which people can voluntarily sign up for and contibute to?

For example, last election Clinton got approx. 60mil votes. Now assuming half of them were in favor of a UHC system that puts us at 30mil.

Even if you want to halve that and say 15mil people are in favor of UHC that is still an enormous amount.

15mil people would give significant buying power from insurance companies i would imagine. 

With 15mil people paying into this same pot, why wouldnt a private program work? Why would you want the governemnt in charge? Could it act like a crdit union where the reps are voted in etc.?

Again, this isnt a troll post, im hoping to get a new perspective on this.

Edit for clarity: this would be a non-profit organization.",Liberal,Private universal healthcare?

"For some background info: I’m a 13 year old male in a conservative Christian school in Georgia, us.

There was a kid who used to be my best friend until maybe September or October of 2017. We used to play video games together, watched some of the same shows, and both played Minecraft. ( yup I was that kid)

Then came politics like a ship breaking apart icebergs in Antarctica. (We learned how to spice up sentences in English class this year.) We started to have some fights about politics blah blah blah. After that, we kind of became friends again but still knowing each other were always thinking about how “wrong” each other’s political views were. Then came more politics. We had many arguments about which opinion was more “reasonable” and which of us was in the wrong. Sometime in that he also accused me of trying to break his iPad which I responded: “why would I want to break your iPad if I would have had to pay for it?” He said: “but that doesn’t matter.” (This accusation came from me dropping his iPad on a couch) I always had a feeling it wasn’t about the iPad it was about being the victim.

Then there was the awkward period. We kinda just pretended each other didn’t exist for a few months. (Not passive aggressively but more like we had never met each other) (this lasted from about Halloween till after Christmas break)

After that there was a time in, I think January where I overheard him say liberals were stupid so I went over to him and asked him if it meant I was stupid and he said yes. He also has called me stupid a few more times more recently.

Also the administration is very conservative and if I told them this story I would get detention. Also if I had called him stupid I would get detention.

I am not someone who would take him calling me stupid personally but it makes me feel uncomfortable that I feel like I can’t tell anyone in the administration or a guidance counselor.

Also sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes.
