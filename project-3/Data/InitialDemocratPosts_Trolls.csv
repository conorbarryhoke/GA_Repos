For example, Scottish distillery methods were used to make Bourbon, which is now an aspect of American culture. Tejano Music is a mixture of German and Polish Polka music and Ranchero Mexican music. If the trend of anti culture appropriation continues, I believe future cultural developments would stop. Also as someone who loves cultures, I like to participate in a lot of them. My room is Chinese themed, I like a lot of foreign music, I like making foreign dishes and have traditional shirts from other countries and I'll be damned if someone accuses me of culture appropriation for enjoying what the world has to offer ",Democrat,Serious Discussion: how do you feel about culture appropriation?

My observation: Yesterday on r/videos there was a post of sacha cohen ""quinceanera"" video clip. Today it is gone and I have been banned for replying to people with pure facts about their mis-information they have on the democratic party.

It seems to me there are a handful of Moderators out there banning Americans who are trying to stop mis-information... but yet they are allowing thousands of russian trolls to just bash away.. If this happened to me I can only imagine how bad this really is.

Note: they banned me for hate speech after providing actual facts that represent the racism ongoing inside of the republican party. I was attacked by russian trolls all night trying to spin it.. did everything I could for actual facts to be presented and allow the users to decide on their own.

Hello,

Please consider taking the attached survey examining the experiences of veterans and civilians. More specifically, the relationship between trauma, interpersonal relationships, and other individual experiences. The purpose of this study is to further understand reintegration difficulties of veterans, identifying coping mechanisms among minorities and civilians, and gaining a deeper understanding of general human attachments and interactions. You must be 18 or older and be a citizen of the United States to complete this survey. All responses are anonymous, and no identifying information will be collected. The questionnaire should take 30-45 minutes to complete.

You will be given the online anonymous questionnaire that consists of a variety of questions. We ask that you answer each question honestly. Upon completing the questionnaire, you will be given a debriefing form with contact information for the Principal Investigator, Institutional Review Board, and several help lines.

You may refuse to answer any of the questions, take a break or stop your participation in this study at any time. This survey is completely voluntary, and you may withdraw at any point.

If you have any questions, please contact Caitlin Stone, Western Carolina University Clinical Psychology alumni, at [cheighes1@catamount.wcu.edu](mailto:cheighes1@catamount.wcu.edu) or Hannah Hinkel, Western Carolina University Clinical Psychology student, at [hhinkel1@catamount.wcu.edu](mailto:hhinkel1@catamount.wcu.edu). You can also contact Dr. Kia Asberg, the Principal Investigator and faculty advisor for the project from Western Carolina University Clinical Psychology Program, at [kasberg@email.wcu.edu](mailto:kasberg@email.wcu.edu).

And Civil Rights may have something to do with it I don’t know if it was the massive decisive factor people say it was.

LBJ is quotes as saying “We’ve just lost the South for a generation” upon signing the Civil Rights Act. Well, he was incorrect.

It took the Democratic Party about a generation to lose the South.  I think Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton did quite well down there, and it wasn’t until 1994 that the majority of congressional seats from down there went to Republicans.

I suppose apart from Civil Rights you need to look at the two parties platforms and see which one lines up most with southern culture.

Which party is it that loves guns, loves Jesus, loves the death penalty, and doesn’t take kindly to foreigners? I guess that’s my answer ",Democrat,What happened to Democratic Party in the South?

The following is just some reflections I have been working on from the Devils advocate position of the Iraq war being necessary.
I know youll hate me for it, but Im curious as to your opinion


It is almost common consensus that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a mistake at best, and at worst, the worst foreign policy decision in recent years. However, coming to either conclusion one would have to overlook facts and circumstances that led up to the invasion itself. The undisputed facts about Saddam Hussein and the time period between the two gulf wars would indicate that a second war with Iraq was only a matter of time. The current situation with North Korea and the Trump administration helps illustrate the potential danger of letting rogue states slowly grow in power and influence. Saddam’s regime was in some ways more dangerous and unpredictable than North Koreas. By the time of the Iraq invasion, it had started a brutal war with Iran, used chemical weapons on its own people, invaded and occupied Kuwait and launched missiles into Saudi Arabia and Israel. During the 1990s, Iraq was constantly visited by United Nations Weapons Inspectors, seeking to investigate and stop Iraq’s suspected development of Weapons of Mass destruction activity.  Iraq ceased cooperation with the inspectors in 1998, and UN inspections would not resume until 2002.

President Bill Clinton acknowledged the threat Iraq posed,  when he signed into law the Iraq National Liberation act of 1998. With nearly universal support of the U.S Congress the Act made leant official US support to helping democratic opposition groups replace Saddam’s government, citing Saddam’s potential Weapons of mass Destruction capabilities as  as only one of many justifications for the act which included:

1.	The Iraq instigated 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, which resulted in nearly 2 million casualties, including chemical attacks on the Kurds, an ethnic group native to Northern Iraq
2.	Iraq’s violation of terms of the 1991 Gulf War Ceasefire, (which  included moving troops to the border of Kuwait in 1994 and attempting to invade and control the autonomous Kurdish region in the North)
3.	The attempted assassination by car bomb of  the Emir of Kuwait and former President George H.W Bush in 1993. 

All of these undisputed facts led to a bi partisan consensus that Saddam’s regime was a potential security threat that had to be addressed. 

Although the Saddam Hussein regime had no role 9/11 attacks and was not officially allied with Al-Qaeda it was a supporter of terrorism in the region and around the world, and paid host to several terrorists including.

1.	Abu Nidal, Palestinian terrorist (top of FBI’s most wanted  list before Osama Bin Laden.

2.	Muhammad Abbas (of the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking)

3.	Abdul Rahman Yasin who mixed chemicals for first 1993 WTC attacks.

4.	In addition to inviduals Saddam helped finance the 2000-2001 Palestinian Intifadah against Israel, awarding cash rewards  (of up to x amount of dollars)  to the families of the deceased. 


In conclusion, Saddam Hussein’s regime was uniquely brutal and troublesome on a level unmatched by most of the United States adversaries, including Iran. With it’s history of terrorism, WMD development, and unprovoked war,…..(will finish conclusion.)

The Dem's use these payouts as chains and they have put this class of people into a new type of slavery. If you like being a slave vote for the Democrat way. High taxes cause business to hold back paying the people or they just move out. The keystone pipeline is GOOD for the environment unless you like it being transported on trucks that LEAK all over the place and are environmentally unfriendly. The child care issue you speak about Congress failed on that one not Trump. Over regulation KILLS business and innovation. This video has so many inaccuracies it is obvious it was not thought out and the whole picture was not looked at. Just look at CUBA- that organization was killing its people and abusing them. The Cuban people are suffering why on earth would we support that? Look at what Cuba was doing to our diplomats. You better open your eyes and start looking at the whole picture since it is obvious you have been brain washed and you believe the main stream media and not thinking about whats best for the US.

My problem is the waste and fraud,  and frankly greed, that is inherent with government.  
     Something that is missing from the Democrat argument of the rich corporations is that corporations do not pay taxes; yes in practice they do, however in reality they simply pass the cost onto the consumers of their product.  The candle is being burned from both ends.
     The current campaign from the Democrat side is for a $15 an hour minimum wage.  On the surface a high minimum wage seems beneficial;  until you realize that all prices across the economy are largely based on labor costs.  Price increases will negate most minimum wage increases and leave many families living in the same conditions.  What will happen however is the middle class that is making over $15 an hour will take a huge hit. 
     We can change things however it has to be a median between all out government, or all out business.
     Together we can make a difference. ",Democrat,Thoughts.

489,"Every other article I've seen since the election is about how white rural Americans felt ""left behind."" And waaaay too many Dems seem to agree. Now, I'm not saying that Dems or pop culture have always treated rural Americans perfectly. I can see how everyone assuming you inbreed can be irritating.

All the same, I wanna call some hard bullshit on this ""left behind rural American"" narrative. They weren't left behind. They got off the bus. Everything they're talking about now, the outsourcing, the lack of infrastructure, the fact that the old jobs are dying, etc. was talked about long LONG before Trump was known for anything but mutilating the NYC skyline.

I hear so many people from rural areas squawking and complaining about how their infrastructure is soooo bad but what have THEY done to fix it? Nothing. Anyone who proposes doing anything about it gets shouted down by the Infowars conspiracy brigades that think ANY public investment (outside of high school football) is part of some grand plan to herd people into FEMA camps or some other junk, the anti-tax whiners, and the people who are opposed to the existence of government in general. Every single time. I've sat in on these council meetings. It's fucking funny. They say they want good infrastructure but the minute it's proposed you gets screams of ""MUH TAXES!"" That's why their infrastructure is crap. Rural America's chickens have come home to roost. You can't neglect your infrastructure for 60 years because you want to keep your precious taxes low and expect it to remain in good shape. Infrastructure costs money.

Low taxes or infrastructure. Choose one.

Outsourcing could have been curtailed too. John Kerry made that a key part of his platform in 2004. But the locals wanted someone ""they could have a beer with."" They were mad about gay marriage (despite none of them being affected in the slightest). They were mad that John Kerry wasn't “manly enough.” Plus, at the time, outsourcing was seen as an urban problem. A problem for ""those people.""

When urbanites, particularly in places like Cleveland and Pittsburgh, were saying ""Hey maybe we should make outsourcing harder,"" in 2003-2004, many people in rural America told us that we should stop being lazy, get off our butts and learn new skills. Stop expecting the government to protect our jobs and revive dying industries they said. Move to where the jobs are. They said that companies should have the freedom to outsource jobs and screw consumers. They were secure in the knowledge that the bad stuff would only happen to the big immoral cities. Outsourcing and corporate corruption (like say, and I'm just using an example from my backyard, an energy company concealing, with the help of the state government, a coal ash spill that contaminated wells and rivers) would never happen in ""God's country.""

And then it did.

And rural America has the audacity to blame ""urban elites."" They say the government doesn't do anything for them but they keep saying that the government is pure evil and should be toothless for anything except fooling around in foreign conflicts. Which is it?

Sorry, as a city dweller, I'm tired of hearing this whole ""rural whites have been ignored"" horse crap. Your entire thing is that you WANT government to be weak and useless. Don't bitch at us city folk when your government can't do anything to help you. You didn't want it to.",Democrat,"I'm soooo tired of this ""left behind rural American"" crap"

580,"The property tax is a community tax. The community pays tax on property into school budgets and City Council general funds. Property tax is a community tax.

If property can/is an investment. And increased property values is the purpose. The property tax can be used as an investment tax, not a community tax.

If Citizen A lives in an apartment an his neighborhood's property tax increased 25% in 4 years. Citizen A's purchasing power has decreased.

If Citizen B buys and remodels a home next to an apartment complex. Over 4 years his property taxes have increased 25%. Citizen B's home value has increased 65%. Citizen B has increased their portfolio.

If Citizen B sells stock and puts it in their savings account. Citizen B is assessed stock sale/investment tax at year end.

If Citizen A takes $200 from pay check and deposits it in savings while standing at the window next to citizen B. Citizen A is not assessed stock sale tax.

If property is an investment and property is not an investment. And the City Council/County Government can raise property values as part of their duties. City can have a happy, wealthy, person and a larger budget if they raise property values. Then property is not a proper investment. It is fraudulent.

Then, the County/City can raise property values to help reassess their citizens portfolio. Which also helps their budget. Property is an investment. Property is a portfolio.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A 30 year homeowner is on a fixed income and can not afford to stay. Homeowner sells house. House is turned into high end duplex. Which helps the citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

The City/County raise property values to help/reassess their citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A community renter can not afford to stay, and moves. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. A 30 year homeowner is on a fixed income and can not afford to stay. Homeowner sells house. House is turned into high end duplex. Which helps the citizens portfolio. Which helps the city's budget. 20 renters and 9 homeowners can't afford to stay and movie. Properties are town down and luxury apartments are build. Which helps the citizen's portfolio. Which helps the city's budget.

Property is an investment. Property is not an investment. Property tax pays for school and budget and city general fund. Property tax is a community tax, so what happened to the community?

Citizen A has a well funded investment account. Politician A can raise/lower dollar amount on Citizen A's investment account. Politician A tells citizen A that he can raise investment account 15% every year. Which will help his budget. If Citizen A agrees, Politician A will lower % from 4% to 3.5% in 2 years, 3.5% to 3% in 4 years, 3% to 2.5% in 6 years, and 2.5% to 2% in 8 years.

That's fraud.

If property is an investment.

City/county benefit from return on investment

If property is a portfolio

City/County do assess worth of portfolio

If property value reflects on City/County budget

City/Count will increase portfolio's value

If property value is increased by high value structure

City/County duty is to approve structures. Structures will always be approved

If property is an investment. But, the property tax is a community tax. Then City/County are required to exercise prudence. IF the property tax has been used to enrich investors and defraud the community. The city/county have acted illegally.

If property is an investment and the city/county have improperly applied a community tax as an investment tax. Exponentially rising costs will eventually remove the community. If, the city/county duty's include – property value assessment – and approval of new construction. And their community is only investors. Then it is not a community, it is a portfolio. And if the community is a portfolio. Then the City/County are not a government, they are investment managers. If investment community can force/coerce/vote added value to their portfolio. It is a criminal operation.

If Sky-scrappers and mega-structures add value. And a large American city has had a demographic shift and growth over 12 years. And the City/County has been using the property tax as an investment tax. Cost of living will go through the roof. If the City/County requests state/federal aid or funding for section 8 housing to house what were formerly housed citizens. Then that is a racket.

If the City/county – in the face of this – approve a new high value structure to increase ROI for community investors. The city/county is openly acting against the non-investor. If this is to continue – then the progressive/mega-city growth will continue – as the community-as-an-investment's children will have to always move to settle.

If property is an investment and property is not an investment. And the investor has minimal effect in overall quality of life of the investor. But the investor can drastically effect the quality of life and world of the non-investor. And the investor has a choice of living arraignments and the non-investor does not. Then the community needs to be planned around the non-investor.

The property tax is not an investment tax. The property tax is a community tax. If property is taxed, not because it is property, but because of its physical location within a community. Then the overall reason for owning property, investment or non-investment, should not be taken into consideration when applying the tax. If it has? If two decades of defrauding the community to enrich investors – causing untold damage to the American Public – resulted in any personal wealth or kickbacks to the City/County then they need to be held accountable. If a government refuses to hold themselves accountable. Then surrounding communities, cities, and counties, effected need to sue to force a cessation of mega-projects until all infrastructure upgrades have been planned for and completed and all necessary arrangements for displaced members of the community have been met.

Might I interest you in Reddit’s own Model US Government? In /r/ModelUSGov, we have an active Federal government with a House of Representatives, Senate, President, Supreme Court, as well as an active state government encompassing six states (all six are made up of the US's real states) each with a governor, assembly, and court system. In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We would like you, a member of a movement dedicated to fighting far-right extremism, bigotry, racism, and hatred to help us do the same within our small community. The Democrats have uniquely passed legislation in order to better the lives of Americans by passing a $15 Minimum Wage, Universal Healthcare, gun-control legislation, criminal justice reform and the elimination of private prisons, environmental legislation, and much more. However, there’s still more to do, and we need your help to prevent the growing alt-right and anarcho-capitlaists from overturning much of the progress we’ve achieved. 

If you would like to join a great community, and participate in a fun and fairly accurate simulation of government politics, be sure to join us on this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModelUSGov/comments/5ymhfb/join_a_party/) and ask to join the Democrats.

In Model US Gov we have many members who propose bills, debate, run for office, and interact with a large community of individuals.

We are currently in the middle of a Federal Election, and the Democrats are facing a tough reelection from Republicans and Libertarians. The Republicans have fielded a presidential candidate who very much resembles Donald Trump in his rhetoric and policy stances. Candidate /u/Viktard has been shown to be vehemently against abortion, universal healthcare, and has been proven to be a puppet for the extremists in his own party. On top of their presidential candidate, the GOP have also provided the alt-right an avenue to take down our Democracy. This is the time for people like you to join in the fight against the right! The Democrats are currently working with the Socialists, who have supported very moderate Incumbent /u/Bigg-Boss for reelection to the Presidency.

If you would like to help our cause, here’s how, and it will only take a few seconds:

1. Follow this link: https://musgov.melect.net/login

2. Follow all the directions. If you are asked to chose which state in which to vote, you are free to chose any irl state. The Democrats are running in The West, The East, the Northeast, and Central States. The map can be found [here](http://i.imgur.com/hnvHrVc.png) of where the irl states are corresponding to our in-sim states.  


3. Vote for the /u/Bigg-Boss(Socialist)/ /u/Aoimushi (Green-Left) presidential ticket, and vote for Democrats down the ballot (if no democrats are in the state you pick, choose our allies the Socialists or Green-Leftists).

Thank you for your help, and may Democracy stand strong against those who seek to destroy it.

 http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/01/us/waiting-for-clinton-democrats-hold-up-court-confirmations.html
""Waiting for Clinton, Democrats Hold Up Court Confirmations"" (New York Times, September 1, 1992)

It shows, sadly, that Democrats weren't above doing what Republicans did.  And yes, it's not with the Supreme Court, but the one just below (headed now by Merrick Garland).
E.g. John Roberts (current Chief Justice) was nominated in May1992, but never given a hearing -- to let Bill Clinton fill the seat, which he did.
If Garland's seat was stolen, then so was Roberts'.  It's one thing to be morally against theft; it's quite another to say ""yeah we stole
your silver, but how dare you steal our gold?!""

And while there's no ""Biden rule"", his 06-25-1992 speech ( https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/SCOTUS%2C%2003-24-16%2C%201992%20Biden%20Speech.pdf ) matters.  Why did he make it at that time, with no vacancy?  He heard that a Justice
might retire, and made his speech to preserve the vacancy for Bill
Clinton to fill.  In his speech, he says ""that would not be our
intention"".  But in light of Biden's effort at the time to preserve
court seats for Bill Clinton, most likely Biden was doing the same
with the SCOTUS seat he believed was opening up.  So he was pursuing raw partisan ends, but covering them with high-minded rhetoric -- exactly what made me livid about Republicans' stance.

And speech isn't action.  But the stalling of Bush court picks to save the seats for Bill Clinton was action, and Biden's speech was part of that action.

My question...The emails that were leaked by Wikileaks, and hacked by the Russians. Democrats have gone out of their way to say that the Russians attempted to influence our election by the hacking of the DNC and Podesta. But they have never spoken to the veracity of the information that was leaked, detailing corruption and collusion throughout the DNC. Why is it more important to say that Russian interference was a bigger deal, than talking about and confronting the corruption that was highlighted in the emails?

I’m /u/randomKdebater, a member of the Democratic party on /r/ModelUSGov. I’m here today to convince you to join the Model Democratic party, institute the laws you have always wanted to see be instituted, debate, and connect with a great community. 

The Model Democrats have already made some great legislative progress, such as repealing the Taft-Hartley Act, increasing the minimum wage to $15, creating a negative income tax, increasing funding for education and infrastructure. The Democrats have also spearheaded almost all environmental and green legislation, championed issues of women’s rights, minorities, legalized gay marriage, and have stood for net neutrality. However, this isn’t enough, because there is still so much left to do. 

The Model Democrats are also a great space; everyone is incredibly friendly, and excited to help out new members get accustomed to the simulation. In the community, you can debate and express your opinion, receive help from more experienced members, and try your hand at creating pieces of legislation. The Democrats also have fun weekly movie nights, questions of the week, and so much more!

Midterm elections are coming up, and the Republican party has been on the rise, doing very well in state elections and turning more and more into its real life counterpart. Not to mention, the rise of a new Nationalist/Fascist party only reinforces that these types of laws are not safe from being overturned without your help.

Whatever Party you do decide to join, we'd be glad to have you in the sim, and I hope you have a great time there as well. We would be incredibly grateful to have you join our sub and have a fantastic, and very realistic experience of government in one of the best communities on the sim!

701,"Dear Grass Roots Dems,

When this all started I was on your side.  I encouraged my brother, a veteran, who was feeling very depressed, to instead get involved.  I even convinced him to come to the Dems because he supported Bernie Sanders more than Trump.  Back then, we didn't know everything we know now.  We were naive to both sides.

But then the Grass Roots Manager, Kasey Carlson, [sent him this notice via email](http://imgur.com/0UlyAdi) basically bending the rules of application to favor delegates that SHE preferred and that's when I knew, something bigger than one person being corrupt was going on.  

That is when I joined /r/CavDef and started really helping to spread the word that hundreds if not thousands of corrupted volunteers in the Dems were ruining that party from the inside out!  When California turned on Bernie and all those ballots vanished, that's when it was certain that I could no long support their party this year.  

I hope every single Democrat or former supporter of them has learned a valuable lesson that coronations are undemocratic and our country would rather vote for a strange orange celebrity with no mental filter than defy those principles.

Even trying to find the right sub to post this on is difficult because the mindset has been ""let's disable"".  Let's disable upvotes /r/Clinton!  Let's disable the whole sub /r/SandersForPresident!  Let's restrict who can submit /r/HillaryClinton!  The most undemocratic approach ever!

I just wanted you to know that you can't go through the next election with this same attitude that you can cut corners and cheat your way to the top.  Now you'll have an even harder time ahead of you though.  Maybe you'll blame her majesty Queen Clinton for her email shenanigans.  But I know that your actions for sure encouraged me to drop my usual policy this year.  I did not vote for a single Democrat because your whole inner organization is completely corrupt.  But you did encourage me to dig deeper.  To show everyone one more example like what we saw in the James O'Keefe videos.  

I want you Dems who tried to start play games with democracy to remember that your actions have consequences and for the next four years I want you to remember we could have won TOGETHER if we had just let the primaries work themselves out because no truth or untruth can lay forever undiscovered in this digital information age.  Anonymity only exists in the voting booth.  Remember that you are part of the cause and effect of this epic failure.  Because guess what?

That the President immediately appoint a supreme Court justice 

Article II section 2 of the U.S. constitution states that the President can appoint a supreme Court justice with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate has explicitly refused to do its constitutional duty. It has given up the opportunity to advise and consent despite being given every opportunity and more than a reasonable amount of time to do so. Therefore, the President must take action and appoint a supreme Court justice. As the Senate has ignored its duty, the President must move forward nonetheless or else allow a defacto usurpation of executive power and an undermining of our constitution. This is the proper response to the ongoing crises created by the Senate.

709,"Dear Friends,

I am deeply sadden by what transpired last night. I do not know what is next. No one does. They say ‘love trumps hate.’ Let’s prove it. Stand together. Stay together. Don’t back down.

To my friends and family who are LGBT, I am here for you and I am with you. I am a straight white male living in America; I will never kiss concrete if I don’t mean to. I will never know what oppression feels like if I don’t seek it. I am seeking it. I am standing with you. I have to do more.

We all have to do more. We cannot stand down. We cannot let this be OK. It starts with us. Each individual, and I can do more and I vouch to do more. I fell into the category of believing this country had taken gigantic steps forward, and that it wouldn’t do this. I was wrong.

I could have done more. I should have done more. We all should have done more. It’s up to us now. We have to no other choice. We lay down and we let them win. They haven’t won yet.

This is on all of us. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and so forth. It is on the Democratic Party for pushing the candidate that we all knew didn’t create excitement, for not accepting the candidate who did create excitement and who would have won the general election.

This is on the Republicans who refused to stand up to a racist, sexist, xenophobic, who paved the way Donald Trump to rise to power. He is a fascist, a dictator with Russia on his side.

This is on the average person who didn’t pay attention to the election, who didn’t fact-check, who didn’t listen, who didn’t think this was possible, who stayed on the sidelines. This is on every one of you. This is on us, Americans.

What is our next step? I don’t know. We have to hope Trump can lead us. But he is not my president. He is not America’s president. I hope I am wrong. I am not.

We have to continue the fight. We have to fight harder. Louder. With more enthusiasm. We must not stand down, we must not let hate win, we must let democracy win out. We must go forward.

It’s hard to see today. I know that. I am struggling to see the light, too. But I am moving forward.

The fight just got tougher, but the bout has not been called. We have this. Let’s keep fighting.

The caucus chairman said at the end of the process, “We have put our stamp on this bill.”The landmark Violence Against Women Act was established in that bill, which has helped reduce domestic violence by two-thirds, a steeper drop than the overall decline in violent crime. And the bill included an assault weapons ban, although congressional Republicans refused to renew it a decade later.But the president also had to appease Republicans to compensate for lost Democratic votes.
