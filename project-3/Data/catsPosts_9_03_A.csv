I thought maybe it was the water itself, so I started using a filter on the tap water. It made no difference. 

I am so frustrated from coming home every day to find that he's spilled his water everywhere, and I'm starting to get worried that he's going to become dehydrated. Please help! What am I doing wrong?

"So atm we have 4 foster kittens. We were supposed to only have 3 but the organisation we are with catched another really weak cat around 3 weeks ago and she is around 3 months old. We took her because no one else could and she had already been at vets in a cage getting treated for 3 weeks.

The organisation we're with told us how sweet and gentle she was, but as soon as I saw her I knew that they misread her completely, I don't know how they couldn't see it.

 She was letting them pet her because she was paralyzed from fear and she was purring to calm herself. We keep her in the bedroom now, away from the others just so she can get some peace. But after being at the vet for 3 weeks, directly from the streets, she is super stressed, hiding completely, barely eating and hissing when we come in the room. 

The organisation thinks she will be adopted quickly because she looks super cute (she does she has amazing big eyes and she's really small for her age). But I honestly can't let anyone adopt her until she trusts humans. I can't risk they will stress her more or wants to give her back because she is not cuddly and friendly.

 She can't take care of herself on the streets, even after being at the vet she is tiny, weak and skinny. I hope I can get her to trust us at some point. Poor little thing is so scared :(

"[Kitty](https://imgur.com/a/DGvD6It)

We moved into our current house two years go.  It was owned by a couple of vets.  It was also vacant for probably a year before it was sold.

They were feeding strays, as there were empty old cans of wet cat food found around the yard.

When we went to look at the house, three strays showed up looking inside the door.

After a while, the strays started to look for hand outs.  
At the time of our move, our previous cat that we had for 13 years passed away.  

We were in cat mourning, so we were not in the mood to adopt a stray.
  
(I know it's silly, but you feel as if you can't get another cat for a while  you are calling the last cat ‚Äúreplaceable‚Äù which they could never be.)

They also wouldn't come near us.

One stuck around without us feeding it, so the inevitable happened.  We fed it.

I honestly don't know if she is feral or traumatised.  

We worked with her.  My husband got her to eat out of his hand.  I can pet her as long as she is eating.  I even got her into my lap to eat by reclining and holding  wet cat food so she has no choice but to be in my lap to get some.  First time she was skittish, the second time, no hesitation.

She is also spayed, or she'd be pregnant by now.  There is a tom cat hanging around eating her food and I'm sure he would have taken care of business if she was able.

The problem is that hands freak her out.  If she sees a hand, she bats at it.  No claws, No hissing, it's a more a soft warning bat.

I give her a good body pet and a neck scratch if she is eating, so, how can she not know she is being petted?

She gives me all the socialization signs.  She comes up to me if I am still, sniff me.  She rubs all over the place, including my legs at times (If I am still)  give me the blinky eyes, and the tummy upturn show, the yawn.

If I sit in a chair, she is underneath it, rubbing.  I catch a couple of pets, but then she looks at me like ‚Äúdid you just pet me?‚Äù  step away, then come back to rubbing on the chair legs to end up getting ninja petted again.

We wanted to bring her in, but, if we can't pet her, we can't pick her up and bring her to the vet.  We can't care for her properly if she won't allow it.

My guess is that the vets that lived here grabbed her and spayed her, so now she doesn't do hands.

My guess is that if she came inside, that would be the last stage.  She just needs to be around us more.  My husband doesn't want to house a cat that won't let him pet her.
My urgency is that this Christmas we plan to be out of town for a week.  I can't leave food out or the other cats, the opossums or the peacocks will eat it in a single day (WHOLE different story).

If we can get her inside, then another family member can visit once a day and make sure there is plenty of food.


How can I get her used to hands touching her?

"I moved to a new place from my parents' home in early August, and I'm about at the point in the moving process where I'm ready to move my cats. I had been living at my parents' for about a year until I found a townhome located about 9 minutes away, and Sibylla had been the only cat until I adopted my second one, Soraya, in January of this year. 

The cats aren't what I would call friends, though they don't outright hate each other; they mostly just ignore one another or have minor spats over territory that are usually instigated by the older cat.

For the latter, my parents' 3900 sqft home has been the only place she's ever known. I put her in my parents' bedroom to get acclimated after I adopted her, and she regularly sleeps on their bed and uses the litter box in their bathroom. It's fair to say that she's as much their cat as mine, though they would say otherwise.

I'm conflicted right now as to whether or not I should take both to my 1800 sqft townhome or leave Soraya at my parents' place. My folks insisted that I take both, or at the very least try it out to see if the arrangement suits them. Sibylla is coming with me regardless since I've had her since 2013, but I'm not sure it's fair to Soraya to change her surroundings again after just eight months with us, especially to a much smaller place.

Thoughts and advice would be appreciated. ",cats,Moving two cats from large house to townhome

"Some back story first for context as I believe it‚Äôs important. If you don‚Äôt have the time to read it all that‚Äôs fine and any help is greatly appreciated. Hopefully it can help others in a similar situation and help those put into a similar situation act quickly. 

In 2011 I was an early 20s depressed college dropout living with my parents. My mom suggested we get a cat as she saw how I had interacted with my housemates kitten. And growing up her family always had cats. They were primarily raised as indoor/outdoor cats. And despite having no front claws we decided to raise our new kitten, Rascal, as one. Since we lived in an urban area in Southern Wisconsin natural predators were at a minimum. Cars and other people were a much greater threat. Thankfully Rascal was a big scardey cat and wouldn‚Äôt let anyone beside my parents or myself approach him. Rascal greatly enjoyed the benefits of being an indoor/outdoor cat. And we greatly enjoyed having him. Rascal has been my best friend for the past 7 years. He could always cheer me up and make me forget about my problems. 

But all of our lives would be drastically changed this past June. About two years ago my parents set in motion a plan to retire, sell their current house of 35 years and move into their new lake house that they were building in Northern Wisconsin. I had a decent paying job and decided to move into a studio apartment closer to my work. After trying to get Rascal to adjust to a studio apartment it was clear it would be best for him to move up north with my parents. Now this posed a big problem as there are a lot of predators up north. But due to his cautious nature (he never fought with other cats or animals of comparable size), him never straying to far from home since he was fixed and the fact that plenty of people have indoor/outdoor cats in hostile environments. We hoped everything would be fine. 

Yesterday my parents made the 5 hr drive down to my apartment to inform me in person that Rascal has been missing since the early am of the 28th of August. Which is very unlike him since he‚Äôs usually out all night (maybe come in for a snack or quick nap), then he‚Äô come back in in the morning for his can of gravy cat food, sleep for most of the day and go back out once it‚Äôs nightime. My parents searched around on foot and asked neighbors if they had seen or heard anything. I‚Äôm pretty mad they didn‚Äôt put out any missing posters yet and they seemed to assume it‚Äôs already over. But today I‚Äôm driving back up with them to search more on foot and print out missing posters. Unfortunately it is a very sparsely populated area with a lot of vacation homes. Best case scenario he‚Äôs waiting at the door or nearby to be let back in. But ultimately I‚Äôd like to know one way or the other instead of running all these possible scenarios in my head. 

What can we do other than searching on foot and putting out missing posters? Additionally what info and message should I put on the missing posters? What‚Äôs a feasible timetable for his possible return?

"Does anyone have any experience or knowledge about why a cat frequently keeps missing the litter box when she urinates. My girls cat keeps missing and it‚Äôs only been happening for maybe a month. She otherwise is or seems very healthy. She is getting up there in age. Her age isn‚Äôt known as my girl found her on the streets on NY during a visit. I‚Äôve been with her for 10 years and she had the kitty for a couple years prior so she‚Äôs is at least 12 if my math is correct(it is..I checked). She has an over active thyroid and is receiving medicine Daily. It‚Äôs a cream that is rubbed on the inside of her ear.  She somewhat new to the medicine so it seems to coincide. She has been on the meds for longer than a month so maybe the amount of time she‚Äôs been missing her litter box is off a little. I clean her litter out every morning before work or when I get up on the weekends which is at the same time and plenty of times it‚Äôs all in the litter and sometimes she completely misses the entire box. She‚Äôs an extremely happy cat as far as I can tell with no other health problems. She was just at the vet 2 weeks ago and received blood work and all was well. Just curios if anyone has some insight. I‚Äôll do some research online as well in a little bit but I know how helpful fellow redditors can be. Thank you in advance for any and all information.

"Hey guys,

So I just recently took in a new cat, and he has been absolutely amazing. Bar none the most loving, friendly, and best behaved cat I've ever had. I seriously do not have a single complaint about him, however I do have a concern.

A few nights back he had what I will call an ""episode."" Basically, I noticed him behaving slightly strangely. His eyes were darting around the room like he kept seeing things in the corners of his eyes, and then he begun to follow and pounce at invisible ""bugs"" on the ground. It's like he saw things scurrying around below his feet and he was trying to catch them. I sat down next to him to try and see what was wrong and I noticed that his pupils were extremely dilated. He kept chasing these things with his eyes and then trying to claw at them. I started petting him to try and get him to relax and he lied down and began to viciously tear up the carpet with his claws while looking dead ahead in front of him with wide eyes. It was obvious that he was absolutely terrified.

I pulled him into my room and sat with him for about an hour while we listened to ""Soothing Cat Music for Cats With Anxiety"" until he eventually fell asleep. The ""episode"" seemed to last around 10-15 minutes, but I can't be sure exactly. I figured it may have just been a one time thing, but last night it happened again.

He never showed aggression towards me, and both times it was obvious he was terrified. I've just never seen anything like this so I'm hoping someone here has.

Thank you in advance.

edit: I forgot to mention, I will be taking him to the vet on Wednesday.

edit: Also, he never scratches the carpet, but in both episodes he did the same thing where he looked dead ahead and raked his claws through the rug like crazy. It was frightening but luckily he didn't behave aggressively towards me. Honestly, he has never once behaved aggressively towards me at all, like he is one of the most easy going cats I've ever seen. Honestly he is so calm its almost detrimental because It's much harder for me to tell what he likes/dislikes because he never nips or scratches if he dislikes something.",cats,"My cat is seeing things that are not there, is he hallucinating?"

"**Background:** I have a rescue who, due to complications, only has four teeth. He is a very picky eater and seems to only truly like chicken and turkey canned cuts (not patte). I have never made cat food before and was looking for feedback. 

**Ingredients / Breakdown**:

* fatty meat - chicken or turkey thigh - 5.5-6 lbs (discard bones)

* 7 oz chicken liver 

* 14 oz chicken heart (optional, if available)

* 4 egg yolks

* taurine - 1/2 tsp ~1800mg

* vit e - 1/8 tsp ~ 350mg

* fish oil capsules - 4 pills ~ 4g

* vit b complex - 2 pills ~ 120mg B1 ~ 150mg B2 ~ 100mg B3, ~100mg B6, ~800mcg folate, ~ 2000 mcg B12 ~ 1200 mcg Biotin ~ 200mg pantothenic acid

* lite salt - 1.5 tsp ~ 8.4g total salt ~ 1740mg sodium ~ 2100mg potassium, ~360mcg iodine 

* l-lysine hcl - 1.5 tsp ~ 4065mg

* ~3 grams, ~.5 tsp of ground egg shell per lb of meat and organ ~ 1183mg elemental calcium. (~1/2 egg shell/lb.)

**Prep:**

I was planning on sous vide'ing the shit out of the organs and meat for around 4-5ish hours so that they'd be as tender as physically possible to make it easier for him to eat, removing the bone, and cutting as finely as possible. I'd add the egg yolk and additional ingredients raw. I'd split the batch into many tupperware containers and freeze, defrosting a new one once the previously thawed one gets low. 

**Thoughts:**

* I chose to cook the meat instead of putting it in raw due to my cat's lack of teeth, figuring that well cooked food would be easier for him to chew. Sous vide for a ridiculous amount of time seems to be the easiest way to make meat fall apart with minimal clean up. 

* I would use bone instead of eggshell, however I don't think that my blender is up for the task. Eggshell seems both easier, and has a preferably lower level of phosphorous. 

* The inclusion of l-lysine hcl is because my cat frequently has discharge from his eyes, making me think that he may have minor cat herpes or autoimmune issues. 

Does anyone see any complications which could arise while making this or feeding it to my cat? Does it lack any essential nutrients? ",cats,Feedback for my cat food recipe?
